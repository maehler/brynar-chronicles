        <p>My parents, Lorenn and Sagdor, are traders by profession. Through their meetings with other traders, and also their travels, they amassed vast amounts of knowledge—knowledge that I sucked up like a sponge. This was something that my parents encouraged. I quickly got an interest for old legends and myths, but in many cases I was outright disappointed in the details. For example, there were a group of heroes in Icewind Dale around 100 to 150 years ago that fought a great posse of demons. They somehow managed to defeat these demons, but the story does not give any details of how this was achieved. This is something that bothers me, and this is far from the only case of missing information in the recollection of these events. Everything seems so clinical and free from emotion, and if I only had an opportunity to go out there and see for myself where these events unfolded, I could make it so much better.</p>
        <p>This was something that kept bothering me for a long time, and by the time I was supposed to take over the family business, I just had enough. At the ripe age of 24, I left my family home in the high forest in order to explore the world. I had heard of a great library south of Baldur’s Gate, and this was were I was headed as a starting point. Apparently, this was the place where the greatest scholars had studied, and their collection of books is unprecedented in Faerûn. There I could stay for a while and read more in depth on the stories I had so far collected. Surely there would be more books and knowledge there than my parents had collected.</p>
        <p>My travels started along the eastern edge of the High Forest. For days and days I could see the great desert landscape of Anauroch in the distance. In Anauroch the flying City of Shade—or Thulanthar—could be found. The city had emerged from the shadow plane shortly after my birth, and it remained somewhat of a mystery, although almost everyone I had talked to agreed that this was a very dangerous place. I would love to go there some day.</p>
        <p>From here, I cut towards the coast and made my way to Baldur’s Gate. I had only heard stories from my parents about this great city, but these stories had evidently not prepared my for what I now could witness with my own eyes. Never before had I seen so many people at the same place, going about their own business, ignoring me as if I had been invisible. Never before had I felt so small.</p>
