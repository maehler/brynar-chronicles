Down in the mine.
The group has taken a short rest, and now turn back to the force field that they found in the north part of the mines.

There is a note on the desk in the room:

> Searched this level, unable to investigate the deeper pools, on the northern fringe, but surely the mining teams were experienced enough to not send people through without a safety line, and without leaving guards behind? WIll leave them for later and press on downwards.

According to Arhan the force field put disturbing images into his head.

Found another pool in the north-western part of the mine.
It doesn't seem to be stagnant.
Arhan sticks his glowing staff into the water and he can see some kind of cracks.
There's some rubble to the north, and there seems to be an opening on the other side.
Brân goes through the crawl space, but there seems to be nothing on the other side.

Brynjar went down into the pool nearby and stuck his spear into the cracks, but nothing happens.
Zamrasard sends a lightning bolt into the pool, but nothing much seems to be happening.

The group backtrack to the elevator and explore one of the northern passages that they still haven't.
Two grey oozes appear and attack them.
Having learnt their lesson by the black puddings, these oozes are relatively easily dismissed.

The small pool with a grate at the bottom in the southern parts seems to be clogged.
Brynjar uses his spear to clear the debris that's blocking the flow of water, and quickly clears the pool.
Removing the grate, they spot a ladder inside the revealed shaft.
They all go down.

It has gone from granite to a more porous type of rock.
The ceiling is also much lower here than on the level above.
There is a mist covering the floor on the whole level.

In one room there are three sources of mist, originating from cracks in the walls.
It seems that these cracks are not made by tools, and not even man made.
One of them is a bit wider than the others, and there is a small cavern visible further inside.
Zamrasard sends a gust of wind into the tunnel, and while the mist was scattered, Zamrasard and Brynjar see the gleam of gold and silver inside the room.

A sphere of darkness falls down upon the group, and a drider attacks.
The group fights really well, and Brynjar deals *a lot* of damage.

In the small cavern there are a number of dwarven corpses lying around in various stages of decomposition.
The gold and silver that was seen earlier seemed to have been deliberately placed to be in clear view from the entrance, seemingly placed for luring people in there.

There is a slab of rock at the end of one of the other corridors.
Brân uses a pickaxe in order to dig into it from underneath.
As he does that, the ground starts trembling.
As Brân stops, the trembling also stops.
They decide to leave the slab be for the moment in order to explore the rest of this level.

In one of the other corridors, Brân stumbles upon an urgosh that is covered in some kind of green, slimy substance.
Arhan senses that the tremors are originating from a single point somewhere north-east of them.
Brynjar feels another set of tremors, but now from the west.

There are three dwarven corpses in a room further in with a note saying they got trapped and that there are Umber Hulks in the mines.

Umber Hulks it is!
Two burst out of the wall immediately next to us.
They have ways of confusing the group, making them perform random actions.

Arhan deals a fair bit of damage using fireballs, and Brynjar also smacks them pretty hard, and they are relatively quickly disposed of.
Diverting the gaze from the creatures was the key to success in this case.

Continue working on the slab.
Reveals a steep chute.
Too steep to climb, so should repel down using a rope.

Brân wants to explore one of the cracks in the wall, presumably being Umber Hulk passages.

Make their way down to the next level of the mines.
It's a bowl-shaped cavern with a lake of lava at the bottom.
Serpent-like layout of the walkway.
Very warm, and it is very exhausting.

Zamrasard rushes ahead of the group, being indifferent to the heat given his demonic background.

A couple of fire salamanders show up.
Brynjar goes through the arch and runs straight into a fireball.
No more eyebrows for Brynjar.
