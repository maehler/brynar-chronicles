> After leisurely playing your lute in the Salted Salmon one evening, Brynjar is approached by Thyrra Finn of the city council.
> She buys him an ale and starts complimenting him on his great knowledge and insight into matters, and his ability to put it in to verse.
>
> “It is a skill not many share.”
>
> Eventually, Thyrra mentions a hobby of hers: trying to recollect old tales and says she’s realised he might share her interest.
> Wondering if he might be willing to help her out, she’ll gladly share what information she has if he brings back any tales, or even better; written down ones, to her.
> Right now she’s working on a chronicle of the heroes of Icewind Dale, about a century past.
> Worriedly she adds that there are signs and similarities between then and now that she can not ignore.
> She knows of the group’s journey from the Easthaven, to Kuldahar and on to the Severed Hand, but there her trail stops.
> They were searching for a way to use powerful scrying to find a terrible secret, lamentatious, Thyrra remarks that she wishes she only had that ability herself.
> She asks if Brynjar might find a way to travel there and seek any clues.
> The elves of the High forest might know more.
> Thyrra had hoped to ask the elven lady they came to town with, but since she left, the only elves left in town are ones that have lived here their whole lives and they don’t know as much as their high forest kin, not to mention the lore the old great libraries of Silverymoon before it disappeared.

Spending a few days in Nesmé, drinking ale at the Salted Salmon.

Find a barge that will take us downstream towards Yartar.
The plan is to disembark just before Yartar, and then proceed by foot towards the road leading to Longsaddle.
Day 1 and 2 on the river pass by uneventfully.
We reach the fork in the river just north of Yartar.
Setting up camp a couple of miles before reaching the road.
The night passes by.
Wolfrika, the dwarf ranger, scouts the road ahead of us.

When reaching a bridge, there is a boulder coming down from a hill on the other side.
It hits Wolfrika and Brân while Pritchard manages to sidestep it.
A wereboar comes down from the hill.
At the same time (almost), a werewolf comes on the road to the south.
Two wererats also appear that shoot at Pritchard with their hand crossbows.

After all the were-things are slain, a troll comes out of the water and sits on the bridge.
It's a giant, and it speaks in giant.
Brynjar understands it.

"Time to pay the toll little ones, gold or blood."

"How much is the toll?"

"ALL OF IT!"

Fiiight!

It seems that the troll is healing himself from the attacks that we're unleashing on him.

After the troll has fallen, it sinks below the surface.
Pritchard dives into the water, searching for the treasure that he assumes is hidden in the depths.
He is grasped by the troll, who has regenerated.
After a while we manage to kill it (again), and it falls onto the shore.
Brynjar chops off one of its arms, and the troll starts to regrow from it.
We quickly manage to kill it off though.
