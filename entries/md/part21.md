In, or rather just outside of Longsaddle at the moment. Arhan has been going through the city in his cat shape, and he managed to find the guy that ran from the fight earlier. On his little adventure he also managed to lay his hands (paws) on a scroll that possibly could turn him human again. Zamrasard together with Br√¢n and some help from Brynjar manage to perform the ritual, and Arhan is now officially human.

Well in the village, they run into werewolves and a wereboar. Arhan, now in his human form, casts haste on Brynjar, turning him into a lean mean killing machine. There are also some wererats around. In the stable connected to the inn, our horses are kept.

There is a big fight between the group, some of the villagers, and a whole bunch of werewolves, a couple of wererats and a wereboar.

In summary: Brynjar killed eeeeveryone. And now we're not really welcome in Longsaddle anymore. But we're not really banned either. It's complicated.
