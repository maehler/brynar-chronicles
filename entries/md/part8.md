We are currently in the dungeon of Kell Belhon.
We are here to cut the head of the snake, i.e. Markarth.
There is currently only a skeleton crew at the keep.
Brân revives the downed dwarf (Umlu).
We continue to explore the dungeon, and the rock gnome stays beind with the injured dwarf.
Barracks with bunk beds (4), dropped carpentry tools, like the beds were being built when the place was abandoned.
Layer of dust on the floor.
More barracks (5).
Seems like they have been used more than the previous room.
Dwarf-sized beds.
Throne room (6; Mithril Maid).
"Kell Belhon, symbol of dwarven and surface friendship."
Brân mutters under his breath: "Nice..."
Eight columns in the room.
A solid stone block (white onyx), something like a conduit, that lines the whole room.
Similar to the white onyx tower.
Leave the throne room and continue east.
Further into the corridor we find more of the white onyx band.
Hypothesis: the white onyx tower distributes the light from the surface down below ground.
The corridor turns once again, and not even our friends with dark vision can see all the way.
Pritchard's excellent sense of orientation reveals that we're almost back where we started, but the corridor is not actually connected to where we started.
T-intersection, 30x30 foot rooms on either side.
Soft light coming in from the outside.
These are probably the eyes of the dwarven cliff face.
The rooms look like modern day conference rooms with whiteboards and all (/s).
Oh my, a secret door leading back to the central chamber of the dungeon, that the orcs seemed to not have found.
Back with Alboorth and Umlu, it turns out that Alboorth has been involved in building this place (maybe we already knew this?), and he can draw us a map of the place.

Pritchard and Zamrasard can smell decay up ahead (7).
Prepare to fight.
Brân and Zamrasard goes first and pushed the door open.
Rows upon rows of rotting hanging carcasses.
Something gleaming on the floor in the back of the room.
Either a dropped box, or a pendant or something on the floor.
Pritchard is making his way towards the gleaming stuff.
Boxes and debris in one corner of the room, and hanging carcasses earlier in the room.
Nothing really suspicious about anything.
Coming up to the spot where Pritchard saw the gleaming stuff, but there is nothing there.
Suddenly, an Otyugh emerges from the rubble and boxes and debris!
Fight!
Goes for Zamrasard, but misses.
A crate gets stuck in its mouth.
Pritchard gets in a sneak attack with his crossbow.
Brân cast sacred flame.
Brynjar hits it twice with his greataxe, while the creature misses me and Zamrasard with its next attacks.
Back to Pritchard, and he shoots him with his crossbow once again.
Brân casts the sacred flame again.
Brynjar finishes off the monster in a flourish where he cuts off both tentacles in one fluid motion before burying the axe between its eyes.

We search through the room and find more animal corpses and rotten vegetables.
We also find an egg, about 3-4 kilos, one foot long.
Brynjar concludes that it's probably an Otyugh egg.
Brân and Brynjar vote that we leave the egg where it is.
And that is the way.
Pritchard takes the egg.

Brynjar reluctantly tears out a paper from his notebook that he gives to Alboorth so that he can draw us a map of the second level of the dungeon.

Umlu was attacked by the orcs and brought back to the keep.
Has been unconcious for quite a while.
Been there for about a week.
Orcs checking up on them every 2-3 days.
Checked up on them yesterday.

The second level of the dungeon has 50 feet high tunnels.
There are houses, and between the outer wall and the houses there is basically a street.

'Do any of you have exprience with orcs?' asks Zamrasard.

'Not any good experiences at least', says Brynjar.

'Did I tell you I was in the army?' says Brân.
'They mostly try to go for brute force and numbers.'

We have two options to get to the second levels, reasons Brân.
Either the central staircase, or the service staircase that we used before.
One idea might be to use any unoccupied house on that level and use that as a base of operations.
The plan now would be to cast invisibility on Pritchard and have him do a first inspection of the second level and see whether there is an empty house that we could occupy.
One scroll is used for this purpose, while Brân also casts a sneaky thing on him as well.
He uses the central staircase to go up.

Arrival plaza (1).
Domed ceiling, polished stone.
Two corridors, 10 feet wide, going out to the main "street".
The white onyx band is present here too, and it emits a low light, probably moonlight.
Going out towards (6) and (7).
Pure gold bank (7).
Peaks into the Pure gold bank.
Empty bank with a lot of teller booths.
Staircase to the second floor, barred with iron bars.
Can't find a way to open it up.

Go out and towards a store (6).
Torches mounted on the outside, burnt out, not to recently though.
Mihril Maid, main supplier from Mithril hall.
Wooden doors.
Peeks in.
Warm glow, fire?
No movement nor people.
Sneak inside, silently.
Fairly clean barracks.
Humans sleeping on the floor, two of them.
Not bound.
Wearing the garbs of Uthgardt barbarians.
Pritchard makes his way back to the group and informs him of what he has seen.
Brân gets suspicious of Brynjar as he hears the news about the barbarians in the store.

Pritchard clears out the warehouse with the barbarians by killing them in their sleep.
Searches the room of the "innocent" people.
In the stable boxes he finds big piles of cloth.
Bedrolls, camping gear.
Recently used, and not of apparent dwarven make.
Firewood and other basic supplies.

The rest of the crew is trying to sneak from the plaza to (7).
Brân and Zamrasard sneaks their way there without any problem.
When Brynjar gets up, he stumbles on a lever, and one of the elevator pads starts to ascend with a lot of noise.
Brynjar starts to run for it in order to get to Brân and Zamrasard, and he makes it there without anyone apparently noticing it.

'Nailed it!' says Brynjar.

From within the Pure Gold Bank we cannot hear anything of this ruckus.
Pritchard sees no orcs nor any patrols on the outside.
Pritchard sneaks around and checks out a store house (8) with huge wooden doors, utilising his invisibility.
Nothing of immediate interest, but tons and tons of crates in here.

Peaks inside The Sunken Stone (5) and sees a massive fat troll looking at him.
And now I mean really fat.
Like, if you would throw a ball at him and miss, it would start orbiting it.
He's also wearing a tiny chef's hat.

Going towards (10).
On the way there he sees a camp of half a dozen tents, and a campfire with a half-orc sitting by the fire.

Going around to (3) and (4).
Poking around, and finally his invisibility cuts out.

Meanwhile, Brân and Zamrasard make their way to the prisoners Alboorth and Umlu in order to get them to the surface, thinking that they might be in trouble considering the elevator noise that Brynjar triggered.
Alboorth is able to get up, but the two dwarves Umlu and Brân fall and tumble down the stairs again.
Alboorth goes to the place where Brynjar is waiting.

Coming back up, the elevator from the top comes down again.
There are 5 figures on the elevator that Pritchard can make out.
Too gangly for being orcs, but can't make out whether they are humans or elves.
One goes off towards (4) and (3).

Pritchard comes in where Brynjar, Alboorth are.
He alerts them to the fact that a bunch of people were coming down from the tower.

Huge orc appears, about 7-8 feet tall.
Apparently, this is Markarth, and he lifts up one of the orcs by their collar and screams to her

'You are late! We've been waiting for this shipment forever!'

'We were attacked by werewolves, we couldn't help it. We dug down the shipment, and we have a map of it'. Markarth takes the map, and then strikes down the female orc.
However, the female orc stands up immediately and speaks.
'You will honour our agreement, and you will provide an armed escort for my sisters. If you do not, we will strike down upon you so hard you wish you weren't born.'

The light in the eyes of this female orc dies and she slumps to the ground.
Markarth seems resonably confused before he collects himself and starts to shout orders in orcish.
Markarth start moving towards (3) and (4), and Pritchard makes himself invisible and starts following him.
Markarth turns right when reaching the main "street".
The humans and a half orc carries a crate past the invisible Pritchard.
They don't notice him, and they are continuing towards 3, and later takes it to The Gentle Goblin (5).
12 half orcs are holding at the camp by the stairs.

Alboorth overhears the orcs.
1 team to leave for escorting someone, or something, while 2 other teams should hunt down the werewolves.

'Escorting people I guess' says Alboorth. 'Something about digging as well, but I couldn't quite make that out.'

Brân and Umlu make their way down the stairs again (stairs at 2), considering that showing themselves would be tremendously dangerous, and not to mention stupid.

Pritchard sees an armored orc at the Arrival Plaza, chanting around the orcs, and a mist surrounds them all.
They all drink something from flasks that they throw at the ground after finishing them, crushing them.
The elevator goes back up with 12 of the orcs.
At the base of the central staircase Pritchard, Brân and Umlu meet each other.

'It's clear up there now, but please, be fucking quiet!' says Pritchard.

They start making their way up the stairs, and once again Umlu stumbles on his own feet and again falls back down to the base of the stairs.
After Brân helping him out, they manage to make their way up the stairs.

Reaching the Pure Gold Bank, the dwarves spot at least six shadows approaching them.
The group make their way to the warehouse (6), and hide the two bodies of the barbarians that Pritchard disposed of earlier.

Brynjar and Zamrasard can hear feet marching outside, including a shuffling sound, like people being dragged along.

'There's someone approaching, let's hide!' says Zamrasard.

The marching feet pass the bank, and the sound diminishes and disappears.

Pritchard, Alboorth and Brân get back to the Pure Gold Bank, and the party is once again in one spot.
We all agree to go to the Gentle Goblin.
The feasting around the camp at (9) has died down a bit.
We make our way into the warehouse, but can't spot anything out of order.
On the second floor we find a room full of light armour.
Unfortunately the best armour is just a studded leather armous; the same that I already have.

Pritchard picks the lock of another room.
On a table in the middle of the room there is a crate, and according to Pritchard it is the crate that was transported earlier.
The room is lined with shelves full of jars containing body parts of all kinds of creatures: monsters, wild animals, orcs and even humans.
Pritchard opens the box, and there is a leather bag suspended in the middle of the crate containing a whole bunch of potions.

Sneaking back to the Pure Gold Bank.

'I suspect Markarth is at the police station thingy (4), but I wasn't able to pick the lock' said Pritchard.

'What about we throw one of these potions at the door. Maybe it'll explode open?' said Brynjar.

'And attract all orcs in the whole keep?' said Pritchard.

'There are no bad ideas, but that's a pretty fucking bad idea' said Brân.

The plan is that we sneak up towards (4), but stay behind while Pritchard tries to pick the lock of that building.
We make our way there, and Pritchard manages to jam the lock.
He keeps trying, but unfortunately he is not very successful.

A new plan is forming, where Zamrasard shapeshifts to an orc, Pritchard goes behind him---invisible---making it possible for Pritchard to get in.
Scratch that, but not all of it.
Also Brynjar and Brân will become invisible, but the rest of the plan is the same.

There are already two orcs in there, and the troll chef is muttering something to them.
Since Brynjar speaks Giant, he understands parts of the conversation.

'You're always eating so fucking much, and on top of that, you cause a hell of a ruckus' the troll says as he hands the orcs baskets of bread and fried meat.
The troll gestures to Zamraorc that he also should take a basket of bread.
Pritchard sneaks inside and up the stairs.
He recognises the voice of Markarth behind a door, as well as the voice of the shaman orc.
It sounds like the shaman orc is reciting a letter, and while doing this he switches from orcish to common.
Pritchard goes down again, and all of us go outside and share the information we now have.

Zamraorc manages to loose the other two orcs, and he returns to the Sunken Stone and the others.
We all sneak into the house, and then up the stairs.
We make some sounds just as Zamraorc comes in, and the troll hears this.

'Get the fuck out of here, you already got your food, you greedy fuck!' the troll screams to Zamraorc before going back to the kitchen.
Zamraorc sneaks up the stairs and joins the rest of us.

Brân and Pritchard can hear continued discussion on the other side of the door, seemingly trying to craft a response to the letter that the shaman was reading earlier.
The voices inside stops.

'What was that?' the voice of Martharth is heard saying.

Zamraorc opens the door and stumbles, seemlingly drunk, into the room.
Markarth stares him down, stands up and screams at him in orcish.
As he does this, Pritchard sneaks in and stabs at the shaman, Eye of Grumsh, and deals quite a bit of damage.
Next it's Zamrasards turn to act.

'Ok, fuck it...' Zamrasard says, while attacking the shaman with his hexblade.
Brynjar then attacks as well, but misses both of the swings of his greataxe.

Brân shoots out his needle thingy towards the shaman, but unfortunately he misses.
Instead he swings with battleaxe.
Pritchard is next in turn, and he more or less pulverises the shaman, who slumps to the ground, dead.

Zamrasard turns his attention to Markarth, and cuts him with his hexblade.
Brynjar swings at him twice, but his greataxe is just deflected off of his shield.
Triggered by this, Markarth swings with his longsword at Brynjar and deals quite a bit of damage to him.
Brynjar reroutes his needle and points it to Markarth, and also---in one swift move---heals Brynjar.

Pritchard attacks Markarth and deals quite a bit of damage with his shadowblade.

Brynjar attacks Markarth recklessly and hits him quite good, and also with his second swing of his greataxe.

This triggers Markarth, and with a couple of swings with his longsword he brings Brynjar to the ground.
This doesn't stop Zamrasard though, who continues to deal damage to him.
Brân also tries to hit him, but misses.

Next is Pritchard who hits with his shadowblade.
The blade sticks in his chest, and Markarth slumps dead to the ground.
The head of the snake has been taken.

Brân picks up Brynjar, and as this happens the troll shouts from downstairs.

'What is all the ruckus up there?!'

Since Brynjar speaks giant, he tries to imitate Markarth.

'I had to go to the loo, and it was a really bad experience I tell you.
You'd better sort out that food, and that fast, before *your* head ends up on a plate.'

'Oh... Ok, sorry boss!'

In the room, the eye of Grumsh---the orc god of war---is emblazoned was hanging on a stand in the room.
The orc rune for the letter 'M'---probably for Markarth---is also present.
The 'M' is rising up from a puddle of blood that is formed by two streams of blood.

Markarth has a chainmail on him, and a long sword as well as a shield.
The shaman has a ring mail, a battleaxe, and some other knicknacks.
Pritchard opens a chest, which triggers a ward that has some kind of sound component to it that makes a massive noise that's easily heard outside the building.
We quickly bar the door and jump out the window.
