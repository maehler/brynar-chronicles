Brynjar takes the last watch before heading towards the treasure marked on the map that we were "given" by Harpell.
He spots some shapes in the sky, and Brynjar is convinced that they were dragons.
The rest of the group thinks that it was more likely a griffon.

Make our way towards the x that marks the spot.
Wlfrica scouts ahead, and she spots a lone rider in a hurry.
She doesn't know if he saw her.

Coming up to the foothills, there are clearly old housing around, at least according to Brân.
Foundations of houses, the occasional pillar.
There's a path that we follow into a small crevasse.
Cavern up ahead, proceed with caution.
Pile of rubble blocking some kind of entrance.
We clear the rubble and enter a cave.

Emtpy initial cavern.
Animated suits of armour guard the way forward.
Brynjar has read about these things.
"Speak friend and enter."
Brân speaks "Mellón", and the automatons reply "Terre Toolemastt", and lift their halbeards.
We pass through, and the armors nod against us.

A big stone sphere has lodged itself in the narrow passage.
Like Indiana Jones.
We all manage to get over the boulder.
There are spikes protruding from the wall ahead, with a—what seems to be a halfling, based on its size—skeleton is stuck on them.
Pritchard manages to find the mechanism that retracts the spikes, activates it, and we continue into the corridor.

Pritchard keeps checking for traps as we go.
At the end of the corridor there is a big demonic head with a bronze mirror for mouth.
The head seems very familiar to the whole group (*cough* Tomb of Horrors *cough*).
The mirror is very well-polished, but there is some tarnish on it, somewhat resembling the shape of a person.
There is a draft from one of the walls.
Pritchard pushes this wall, and it rotates to reveal a corridor.

The floor further into the corridor starts to resemble a slush, almost like compost.
Composing remains of small animals, some plant matter as well.

A swarm moves towards us.
Fiiight!

The first wave is killed off rather quickly, mostly thanks to Brân and his Destroy Undead stuff.

Finally, about 50 zombies are slain, and we can continue.

We find a weird wall that Brynjar eventually pulls down.
There are some chests in there, and something that Pritchard deems is a pressure plate.
He disables the pressure plate and moves to one of the chests.
God dammit!
It's a mimic!
Fiiiight!

We manage to kill off the two mimics, and Brynjar is intrigued by the pressure plate in this new hidden room.
Brynjar throws one of his hand axes on top of the pressure plate.
This triggers something that drains the floor in the corridor.

We reach a room with two large wooden doors.
There are three flasks under some rubble in the room that Pritchard manages to dig out.
It seems to be some kind of multi-component trap that, when mixed, the contents of the flasks would trigger some kind of gas/bomb kind of thing.
