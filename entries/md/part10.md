The crew goes for an ale at the salted salmon.

'First round's on me' says Brân as he goes to the bar.
He orders a round of beer, and a brandy that he pours into one of the steins.
He hands this one to Brynjar.
Brân is starting to be suspicious about Brynjar and wants to interrogate him

Pritchard starts to tell exaggerated stories about his role in their adventures so far, how he has done all the planning, and most of the fighting.

Brynjar keeps performing, and gets a total of 30 gold for it by making some advertisement for the establishment.
Brân seems happy with the explanations that Brynjar gave.

Sleep.
Morning comes.
We all wake in our separate rooms.
Hirven Ira comes and says that Stouthand has returned, and he will be ready to see us after he's had a short rest.

The group head to Sook's Jewelery store by the Golden Goose in order to get rid of some stuff in exchange for gold.

On the way back to the citadel, two guards from the Golden Goose stop us and inquire about a song they heard last night at the Salted Salmon (definitely didn't tie a guy and stuff him in a closet).
Their boss wants a word.
Tries to talk their way out of it, but fail miserably.

Back at the citadel.
Meets Hirven Ira, and she takes the group to the council chambers, and Marshal Stouthand.
Tyra Finn, Albot Sook and two members of the Griffon tribe present.
Pritchard tells the story of how Markarth was taken down, and puts himself in the center.
Now, time for a reward.
Torben Stouthand offers us to choose from a selection that they have.

Suddenly Grog appears in the window.
He wants to know what happened to his acolytes.
Brynjar breaks after a while and admits that he killed Bones, by accident.

The offers are

- Knighthood, property within the city walls, serving the city, and 750 gold each.
- A barony outside the city walls, and 1500 gold each.
- 3000 gold each.

They give them Markarth's letters, and discuss about the Uthgardt barbarians and them siding with orcs.

Banquet next evening and our adventurers are guests of honour.

The group decides to go for they barony option.

Going down to the blacksmith to see if we can get some stuff.
The elderly dwarven blacksmith greets us.

'How was that axe, master dwarf?' she asks Brân. Brân had forgotten that the axe was on loan, but he manages to get the axe for a good price, and at the same time he lines it with silver.

Brynjar asks for a half plate armour.
Will be done within a week.

Zamrasard wants a breastplate.

Washing our clothes at the citadel.

Hirven and Tyra approaches us in the afternoon, and we're invited to meed them in Hirven's office.
They go there, and they want a chat about what has been found so far.

The tantrum potion acts similarly to rage.
The resilience potion grants significant damage resistance.
Potions of regrowth is basically regen.

Hirven and Tyra think that the potions are brewed by witches, or hags, and the potions are probably brewed by torturing sentient beings in order to obtain some of the ingredients.

Pritchard talk to Sook about the price for the stones that we want to sell.
He manages to get a deal where we get 3500 gold pieces and a supply of wine and beer to our new estate for a year.

Brân gets his axe from the blacksmith.

When the group gets out of their rooms, a small boy is waiting outside of Pritchard's room.

'Ah, Mortimer, I've been waiting for you. Do you have the chest?' asks Pritchard.
Mortimer runs off and comes back with a big heavy chest and brings it into Pritchard's room.
Brynjar, Zamrasard and Brân are very confused of who this Mortimer person is.
The group heads over to the banquet.

The group is invited to sit down by the honorary table.
First meal: grilled fish, paired with a hearty wine.
Main course: grilled lamb with a very nice cream sauce and oats and a bit of salad.
After the main course, Stouthand stands up and starts having a speech.
After a while he motions to the group and asks them to stand up.
They are now Barons of Sunset Bend.
Dubbing ceremony, and they rise.
From there on, the group remembers nothing.

The morning after, Brynjar is the only one who wakes up with a massive hangover.
Apparently he performed his whole repertoir during the evening, and also some improvised songs that were more or less well recepted.

Checking out the barony.
A few small buildings, a main manor, a smithy/workshop, some warehouses.
The group pitches in for a first downpayment of the rebuilding of the barony.
1000 gp to start with.

Now, where to next?

Where were those potions made that Markarth were requesting?
