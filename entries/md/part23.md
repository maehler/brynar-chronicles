Coming up to Mirabar.
Giant hole in the middle of the city, mine?
The city is dirty

Brân and Brynjar look for a healer, and are pointed to an island outside the city walls.
Finds a very pretty woman in a small hut that is very messy.
She says she can cure them, but not until the coming afternoon, and it will cost 10 bundles or iron bars, equivalent to 500 gold.

Get cured.
Pritchard haggles a bit and we get a bit of a price reduction.

Getting to the undercity.
A great cavern.
Elevators goin down into it.
Getting patted down both aboveground and in the cavern.

It seems that the doppelgängers imitating the group have been in Mirabar recently, and they might still be around.

In order to get lodging, they need to write their names in the guest book.
Wulfrca invents some new names for the ones that definitely have been imitated by the doppelgängers.

Pritchard -- Glen Everdale
Brynjar -- Butch Greenman
Brân -- Gondly Scarfhaven

Get mithral armour for Brân, Zamrachad, and Brynjar.
