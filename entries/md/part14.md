Making our way back to civilisation.

Goop scooping.
Grab horses and civilians and what not.
Head back towards Nesmé.

Get back down to where the orcs were slain, they have been rearranged into something like a roadblock.
Probably the work of werewolves.
Spend the night at this roadblock.

Two watches during the night: Brân and Zamrasard.
Slept peacefully through the night, but we stirred during the second watch.
Was someone talking?

Back in the saddle.

Run upon another orc body further along the path.
Holding up his hand as in a stop signal.
Three slashes across his chest.
Dead.

Go on until 18-19 in the evening.
Mortimer is being taught to shoot a light crossbow.

Brynjar first watch.
Hears something in the camp.
It comes from Brân's backpack.
Brynjar wakes him up, and he opens his backpack, very recklessly.

"Sure Brynjar, let's take a look in the backpack."

A rat scurries out with a piece of meat in its mouth, and it disappears.

The next two watches from Brân and Zamrasard pass by uneventfully.

Moving down towards Kell Bellhon, Brynjar hears snarling and the clattering of weapons further along the road.
Further ahead there is a dead orc lying on the ground, and further up ahead there are more orcs being mauled by a werewolf.
Fight!

The werewolf ends up running into the forest.
All the orcs are dead.

The werewolf comes back, but doesn't attack us.
It speaks!
And it seems to be a female.
The werewolf seems to be shrinking, going dwarven.
A young dwarf maiden.
It's Wolfrika.
She was apparently attacked by a werewolf while searching for her brother, but miraculously survived.

She will travel with us to Nesmê.

Rest again, now between Kell Bellhon and Nesmé.
In the morning, Brân cures Wolfrika from her curse.

In two days time we make it back to Nesmê.
Construction of the estate is ongoing, and the work on the cellar is underway.

There is a lot of commotion going on inside the city gates.
Halflings?
Half-gnomes?
Half-dwarves?
Not purebreds, that's for sure.

Leiutenant Rawk, greater scion mercenary company.
In the city to help out with the orc infestation, but that has apparently been handled already.

Find Stouthand and let him know that we have things to report.
The council is assembled and we show them the head of the hag.

To the salted salmon.
Time for some celebration!
