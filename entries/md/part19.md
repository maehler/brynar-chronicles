A bunch of mummies have been slain, but there are some of them left still. The group rests and tend their wounds. Brân takes care of the wound in Pritchard 2's forehead; the "X" that Pritchard 1 cut.

Zamrasard takes all the explosive potions and the oil and goes for the chamber with the mummies. He manages to attract their attention, and he scurries back with a tail of mummies.
Brynjar breaks the hinges of one of the doors leading to the chamber in order to slow them down.

A wraith appears behind Zamrasard and tries to reach out to him with its wispy hands, but misses him. He turns around in order to try to swing at the wraith.

Zamrasard has come out from the door, together with the wraith. Brynjar in the end deals the final blow and kills the wraith.

We go into the chamber and get rid of the lid of the sarcophagus, and inside are a few things that seem to be magical: a shortsword (necromancy), a belt (transfiguration) and a necklace (evocation).

Moving out, we hear voices by the mirror, behind the closed hidden door. It's us!

Trying to avoid a confrontation with ourselves, we wait until it's dead silent. Opening the hidden door, we find fake Zamrasard dead on the ground. He's still got his gold though! Going back towards the cave entrance, it seems that there is some ruckus going on outside. The villagers from Longsaddle are here, and it seems they are lynching fake Brân and fake Brynjar.

The plan is to sneak out and try to avoid a confrontation with the villagers, as it seems they are quite unhappy with whatever we could have done to them...
