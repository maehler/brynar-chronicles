Travelling to Nesme.

"Do you know how the Marchion exerts her influence on people as us?", Arhan asks Hildur Ardiel.
"Your unwavering commitment to what is right?", she replies.

She might be controlling the minds of very senior people in the city of Mirabar, through the means of the mind devourer larvae.

Plan to go upstream towards Witches Vale and cut through the Lurkwood, past Kell Belhon, to Nesme.

After three and a half days on the road, Wulfrica takes off into the forest, towards Kell Bellhon.
Getting colder.
Clear days, no rain.
Unsettlingly quiet in the forest.

After another two days they reach Kell Bellhon.
Early September, a month or two since they were here last time.
Just passing by the fortress, and keep following the road toward Nesme.
Wulfrica says that it seems dwarves have been using the road recently, wagons as well.

By midway of the tenth day they pass through the Will-o'-Wisp infested barrows.
The walls of Nesme rise in the distance.

Passing the manor that is being built for them.
Making great progress.
Basement level finished yesterday.
Expect to have the roof in place before first snowfall.

The city of Nesme seems to have been nicely repaired after the orc battle.
Back in the citadel after bein on the road for about 1.5 months.

Making their way towards the citadel and try to find some council member in order to arrange a council meeting where they can present their findings.
Heading to the Temple of Ilmater to see if someone is there.
Temple has been rebuilt, but is still a ramshackle building.
They are grateful for their generous donation.
After having gotten rid of the orcs, trading has become easier to manage.

"As a healer, what do you know about parasites?" Bran asks the healer in the temple.

Has not come across any brain parasites.
For other parasites there are some herbal cures that can be employed, but they are bitter pills to swallow, both literally and figuratively.

Back to the citadel, and they meet with Marshal Torben Stouthand.
Brynjar tries to tell him about the brain slugs, but his words are stopped before they manage to leave his mouth, and he forgets what he intended to say.
He hands over the documents from the Marchion.

Arhan tells him that they now also, partly, know the identity of the Marchion.
He suspects that she is either a half or a full dragon.

The marshal had contact with Mithral Hall.
The clearing of Kell Belhon has not gone unnoticed, and they will retake the fortress.
Both good, and possibly bad, for Nesme.
Bad in terms of trading, but could probably be negotiated with them.

A servant comes in with a big tray of dried meat and fruits, as well as a large amount of wine.

The Marshal opens the letter, and his facial expression goes from surprise to outright anger.
"She's trying to bully us to send troops and supplies, as well as an annual tribute of gold. This is outrageous!"

Bran goes to the temple and he tries to contact Ilmater with a single question that he wants an answer to.
"Do I possess the power to rid myself of this worm?"
The answer to this is not really straightforward.

Arhan wants to get introduced to the lore master of the city in order to investigate some things.
Herabin Ira, older halfling.
"What's your business, what is the information that you seek?"
"Information about the underdark, creatures named Illithids, and what powers they possess."
Arhan doesn't immediately find anything, but is told by Herabin that Tyra Finn can help out in finding out if any information is available.
"Mithral Hall could be a better place to search for this type of information."

Next up: Council meeting.
