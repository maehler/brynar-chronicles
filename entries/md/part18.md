Barred door in the dungeon.
Brân thumps on the door with his shield.

After a while a voice speaks out in a language only Brynjar understands: giant.
After a short conversation, the door bursts open and two giant skeletons appear.

After a pretty messy fight with a lot of damage dealt (Brynjar more or less takes care of both skeletons himself), the skeletons are slain.
In this room there is another set of double doors, apparently barred from the other side.

Zamrasard and Brynjar hears a dragging, coughing sound from where we came.
Brân and Brynjar go to investigate, and they find Pritchard.
He is bloody, and says "You killed me..."
Pritchard checks this guy out, and it seems to be him, 100%.
He even knows things that Pritchard have kept secret from the rest of the group.

We don't really know what to do about the second (improved?) version of Pritchard.
Getting through the second set of double doors, there is a wind going back and forth through the corridor.
As we reach the end, there is an air elemental waiting for us.

The dungeon seems to have the layout resembling internal organs.
We are currently in the lungs.
Brân finds a hidden door leading to a stairwell leading up to a small room with an archway with draconic writing on it.
there is also a golden throne in the room, as well as a statue of a golden cobra in a corner.

There is also a kitten in the room.
Who speaks.
Her name is Arham, and it apparently is not his ordinary form.
Apparently put in this form by some old netherese undead woman.
Arham thinks that this woman is the one who has been referred to as mother.
Arham also says that there is another chamber to this dungeon, through a hidden door next to the cobra.

Pritchard and Brân manage to get the door open, and inside there are some gemstones in there, that they collect.

We go back to the other lung, but there are no apparent passages there.
The kitten Arham says that they were on an expedition in Anauroch before he got here.
That is quite some ways away.

Going through the doors at the end of the corridor, it leads to a smaller room.
Brân goes into the middle of the room, and as he does, wooden spikes come out from the walls, seemingly chewing on him before spitting him out.
Going further, there is a bigger room with sarcophagi lining the edges of the room, 20 in total.
In the middle of the room there is some gear lying around a coffin, which looks like it was made for a half-dragon.

There is a mosaic on the opposite wall of this big room.
It is a map of Fâerun with five locations marked on it.
One of them seem to match with the place in the Grifon Hills where we entered the dungeon, two of them in present day Anauroch, one at Hellgate Keep in the high forest, and one north east of Grifon Hills.
The cat Arham looks interestingly at Brynjar as he studies the mosaic and takes notes, as well as annotates his own map with the markers on the mosaic.

Zamrasard start throwing around Eldritch blasts in order to open the sarcophagi, and this prompts 10 mummies to wake up from their rest.
Fiiiight!

Brynjar gets some kind of curse from one of the mummies where his maximum HP will go down with 3d6 (?) every 24h.
If it drops to zero, his body will turn to dust.
It can be cancelled with a spell.
