We go back to the small corridor that's outside the room the group is currently in.
As soon as we get out of the room, the big double doors close shut close behind us.
The chains in the ceiling are rattling again.
Pritchard doesn't see where the rattling is coming from, but he aims his crossbow towards the sound and shoots.
He completely fumbles though, and the arrow falls down at his feet.
There is snickering coming from around us, but if it comes from any kind of being, they are definitely invisible.
The corridor is narrow and dark, and Brân offers to go in and check it out.

Brynjar ligths one of his torches befor going in afer Brân and Zamrasard.
The ceiling becomes lower and lower and eventually becomes dwarven-height.
Brân opens the door after Pritchard checked it for traps.
Immediately upon opening, we hear sobs and children's screams.
It's obvious that the screams are screams of pain and suffering.
There is a storage room immediately to the right behind the door full of food.

Adult voices/screams on the left and infants on the right.
There is a cell on the left, and there is a sobbing woman inside.
She scurries into the corner as she sees us.
On the right, there is an infant on the floor.
Zamrasard goes to check on the infant, but he's not too familiar with human (or even humanoid) babies, so he's not able to say too much about it.
As light from Brynjar's torch reaches the woman, she is asking for her baby.
The baby in the opposite cell is likely her child then.
Pritchard aims his crossbow at the woman, threatening her.
The rest of the group tries to stop him, and succeeds.

"I see that you haven't played good cop bad cop. Very well, handle it your way then." Pritchard says as he walks further into the corridor.
He then sees two new cells with only a baby in the right cell.
Further in there are two new cells with a human woman in the left cell and a baby in the right cell.
In the next cell from these, there is another woman, very similar to the woman in the previous cell.
There is no baby on the other side, but the woman is heavily pregnant.
In the last two cells there are two women, bound and gagged.
They are very similar to each other as well.
Pritchard undos the gag of the first one, and she asks for her sister.
Pritchard goes undos the gag of her sister and frees the hands of both of them.

Sounds like all of them are coming from Mirabar.

Brynjar whacks the bars with his axe and manages to break one of them loose.
He kicks it in and lets her sister out (Alma and Anna).
Brân gives a handaxe to Anna.
Brynjar continues to free the rest of the women.

All the children and women gather in the store room.
Anna and Alma joins us, as well as Urdan.

The two slaves that went running as Brynjar tried to convince them to get out of there didn't get very far.
They are lying dead on the pile of bones close to the entrance.

Pritchard is shooting the ceiling again, this time with a burning arrow.
He fumbles again though, and the arrow just lands at his feet.
He decides to shoot again, this time successfully, but he doesn't hit anything, and he doesn't see anything from the light of the arrow.

Urdan, Anna and Alma decides that the coast is clear, and they go to get the rest of the women and the children in order to get out of the cave.
They eventually get out into the main cavern.

Brân hears something from the door with the three locks at the bottom right.

"Something is coming through the door!" he yells to the others.
"Prepare yourselves!"

The door opens, but there is nothing apparent on the other side of the door.
Brân and Brynjar hears a whisper saying to return their property and then come for a chat.

We decide to confront them, and approach the room.
It is a bedroom with three beds.
Lavishly decorated.
All the decorations seem to be grotesque and macabre.
Body parts, shrunken heads, dried ears, and all kind of shit.
There's always a precense of death and decay, and there it the sweet smell of death lingering.
Brynjar looks underneath one of the beds.
There is nothing underneath the bed, but there are scratch marks on the floor.
Pritchard takes the torch from Brynjar and sets the beds on fire in order to provoke something.
The room quickly fills with smoke, and we leave the room.

Three beds, three horses...
Pritchard puts a bolt between the eyes of one of the horses.
It falls to the ground, dead.
With that, a woman materialises in the room.
A hag!
Fight!

Brynjar rushes her and attacks.
In the next round, Brynjar is frozen somehow by the same hag he attacked.
The very wounded woman rises up and screams as she drops her visage.
She attacks Zamrasard with lightning.
Both Zamrasard and Anna manages to dodge the lightning bolt, but the frozen Brynjar stands where he stands and takes quite a bit of damage.
He's not able to move at all.

Eventually he gets loose.
The green hag get really beat up before she just vanishes into thin air.

Brynjar's axe doesn't seem to do much in terms of damage to the hags, so Brân throws his silver axe to him.
With this he manages to kill the green hag.

We finally manage to kill off two of the hags (one green and one black).
The last black hag manages to vanish at the last moment.

Brân finds a hidden room neighbouring the bedroom filled with treasure.
4995 gold worth of gold, gems, and other things.
There is also a single potion flask on the table (witches' brew).
It looks like it's empty, but the weight of it says otherwise.
There is also a stack of fine clothes, dresses, made for humanoids.
A bunch of letters in the clothing.
One from Markarth, one from the Lady, one from mummy, and one labelled lady and lord.
