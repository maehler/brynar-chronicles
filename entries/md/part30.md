The group has holed up at the inn in Mirabar, waiting for either the interrogation of the Pritchard doppelganger, or that the warding glyph at the house is triggered.
Tehey instead decide to try to arrange a meeting with the Marchion.
Question is how to go about that.
They decide to go to the Axe headquarters to see whether they could arrange a meeting with her.
Zamrachad will do the talking, and he asks for protector Ardiel.

"Have a seat" the person at the front desk says to Zamrachad.

She's not in her office.
We could leave them a message, or we could go to the Marchion's offices and inquire there, but likely be dismissed.
Another option would be to go through the council.
Oondar would be an option, since we already have had some contact with him.

He's in his office, behind a pile of paper that almost completely obscures him.

"I wouldn't want to use my political postition to arrange such a meeting, as it could affect my possibility to arrange meetings with the council in the future" he says.

"Have you ever seen her face?" Brynjar asks.

"No. No one has ever seen her face" he says.

He says that he has acquired a magical wand that could be of use in order to get back down into the mines.
He doesn't have it in his possession at the moment, but he will call for them as soon as he has.

Instead of trying to go to the Marchion's offices, they decide to go to the pub and just tell stories about their previous adventures.
Sleep through the night.

Brynjar is woken up by a knocking on the door, but as he opens, he can't see anything.
Until he looks down.
Oondar is standing there.
He wants him to gather the rest of the group and meet him in his office.
They have seven minutes.

In his office he pulls out a lacquered box, about a foot long.
It has a sliding lid, and the insides are draped in fabric.
Inside is a glass rod, a bit worn.
Arhan checks it out, and he concludes that it is a rod of invisibility.
There are some cracks in it though.
It should have enough charge to make one or two of them invisible, at least for long enough to bypass the guards by the mine.

Back to the tavern for breakfast and proper identification of the rod.
It is a rod of invisibility and it has four charges left.

They go to the axe of Mirabar to check if Ardiel is in her office, and already when they enter, they are greeted with that Ardiel wants to see them.

"Welcome. We've had some development with the interrogation of your companion."

She doesn't think that he is a doppelganger based on what they have gotten out of him so far.
She expects him to break within a day.
Regarding the meeting with the Marchion, Zamrachad tries to talk Ardiel into it, but failed.

Decide to go down into the mines, using invisibility to get past the guards.
Arhan and Zamrachad manages to sneak through very silently, while Brynjar stumbles and makes a lot of ruckus.
Even so, the guards are just confused to where the sounds come from, but they are after all close to the smelters district.

They also sneek onto the elevator, and there is a guard sleeping just in front of the elevator.
The lever for lowering the elevator is just outside the elevator.
Arhan conjures his unseen servant, which makes Arhan drop his invisibility, that pulls the lever.
The elevator starts moving with a loud clunk.
The dwarf wakes up.

"Hey, who are you, and why are you going down there!?"

Zamrachad casts suggestion at the dwarf, and he succeeds to convince him to leave them be.

Down in the mines.
Go to the magical barrier, and Arhan manages to dispel parts of the barrier, but not the whole thing.
He tries again, but is not able to dispel the rest.
Zamrachad sticks his glave into the barrier, and it penetrates a couple of centimeters before getting stuck.
Properly stuck.
Brynjar manages to pull it out with a huge demonstration of strength.
The barrier starts to vibrate, almost like a membrane, and to ring out like a gong.

They decide to get the hell out of dodge, and to go down to the fire pit at the bottom of the mine.
Arhan casts his fire shield spell, Zamrachad is immune against fire naturally, and Brynjar drinks one of the fire resistance potions in order to withstand the heat down there.

Arhan stands on the platform out in the lava pit and starts to sketch the eggs and the altar in order to have some type of visual representation of this place.
While he is doing that, Brynjar and Zamrachad go to the dragon horde in order to collect some more.
Even though Brynjar knows about the pressure plate that triggers a fire ball, he fails to avoid it.
However, he is able to avoid most of that fireball by more or less scaling the wall of the small cave.

Brynjar spots two small bags in the pile of treasure, velvet, one black and one green.
Crystalline stones, and one has a strange symbol, like a pendant.

- 3 platinum bars (3000)
- 9 gold bars (4500)
- 1000 gold pieces
- 2350 gold pieces worth of gems

Arhan arrives in the cave.
Brynjar manages to destroy the stone dragon head in the cave, and this exposes a wand of fireball in the mouth of the dragon.
Arhan more or less just reaches in and just grabs the wand out of the mouth of the head.
The wand is a wand of fireball with three charges left, and it looks like it can regenerate charges with time too.

They gather on the level just above this fire pit and take a short rest while Zamrachad tries to figure out where he has seen the pendant they picked up before.
He says that it reminds him of an old friend on him.
He was a drow.

Arhan fails to identify the amulet, but it has the same type of magic as the barrier above.
Could it be a key?

They are now standing in front of the force field which is partly opened from Arhans previous attempt at dispelling it.
Arhan takes the amulet and does an arcana check on the amulet, but he's not sure how the mechanism works, and it might not be necessary to wear it.
A spherical opening is starting to appear, and it seems to respond to the amulet.
The force field is about 20 cm thick, and the opening is about 2 m tall and 1 m wide.
Arhan stands in the doorway while Zamrachad and Brynjar passes throught the opening.

They end up in a kind of dark place.
The stonework starts out as something obsidian-like.
A bit in, the stonework changes to something somewhat resembling bone.
The ground is mushy, but they don't leave footprints.
It is completely black in this place.

Arhan pokes the ground with a crossbow bolt, and it seems organic.
A wound-like feature forms, but quickly closes up again.

After having investigated the wall a bit more, it is actually a bit see-through.
More like cartilage than bone.

Arhan casts light, and reveals an environment that is not entirely dissimilar from the insides of the space worm from "The Empire Strikes Back".

The space opens up into a room with two lobes on either side.
There is also some type of doorway in this room.
There is a sound coming from the left.
Kind of a chewing sound.

There's another membrane-like door up to the left.

The membrane door-thingy straight ahead is stretched thaught, almost like a drum skin, with something resembling veins at the edges.
It's almost as if this place is alive.
Arhan notices that there is a vertical line across the membrane, like scar tissue.
Maybe someone cut themselves in.

Zamrachad uses his glave to cut an opening in the membrane, and small amounts of a blood-like liquid is released.
The membrane parts easily, and the group passes through.

Here is another membrane just inside, and there is a corridor continuing to the left.

The colour of the floor changes between the different membranes.
The group decides to go back to the first room in order to investigate this fully before proceeding.
Past the membrane from the first room lies a humanoid figure.
It looks like a gnome.
He's lying on his belly, seemingly unconscious.

Arhan flips him over and tries to rouse him.

"Are you Endar?" Arhan asks him.

After a while he manages to answer properly, and yes, he is Endar.
He tells them the story of how they got down into the mines, and what they found along the way.

They decide to let Endar go up to the surface and tell them how they saved him, and that the guards should let us back to the surface without any arguing.

As they start to lead the wounded gnome out from this weird cave, Brynjar discovers a being behind them.
It's a mindflayer!
Fight!

They can feel a desire from the mindflayer directed towards the pendant.
After a bit of fighting and the mindflayer going invisible a couple of times, and Endar ending up in flames, the mindflayer escapes.
The pendant is still in their possession though.

In retrospect, this cave probably served as a type of prison for the mindflayer.
Endar was probably taken over by one of the brain creatures, and was not more than a sock puppet for the mindflayer.
His death could most likely not have been prevented.
In the end, it got what it wanted: freedom.

Going back to the surface, they are met by a large contingent of armed guards, both dwarves and humans.
They say that the Marchion wants to see them.
The group is taken to the Marchion's headquarters, and she appears before them.
