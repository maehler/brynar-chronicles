Still in Mirabar, thinking what to do.
Wlfrica still in the clinic.

Contact the Harpers about meeting up with the Marchion.
In order to do this they would either have to be noble, or be part of an official trading company.
Just so happens, the whole party are nobles (with the exception of Arhan), with their barony just outside of Nesme.
Why a meeting?
First and foremost warn her of the planned attacks.
In one of the letters it said that Mirabar was next to fall, after Nesme.

Plan: pick up Wlfrica, get to the surface, get some fire resistance potions, get back down into the mines.
Going back down into the mines is going to be risky, and they might ultimately be punished for this.
Executed even?

Go to the Axe of Mirabar's annex, and the priestess has good news.
Wlfrica is back, at least mentally, but it will take a few days before she's on here feet again.
Leave her for another day.

Make their way to the elevator to the surface.
Zamrachad want to check out the inn where he was recognised to see if the other Zamrabob has been back.
He is greeted by the bar maid: "Heeey! It's the birthday boy!"
They offer him 10 fish grogs and big steins of mead for the others.
After a bit of talking, it turns out that it was Pritchard who arranged this.

"It's from your friend, handsome fella', long black coat, top hat.

Brynjar will definitely write a song about this!

After the seventh grog, Zamrasard collapses into a barrel of pickled herring, knocked out cold.
The rest carry him up to his room (which they still have booked since their last visit).

They go to the healer, Wilhelmina, on the small Island south east of the city.
Opening the door, smoke billows out from the small hut.
It turns out that Wilhelmina is high as a house.
As the hut is evacuated of smoke, she starts talking: "Close the door. You are letting all the stank out."

She points them to the potions, but it is pretty difficult to tell what is what.
Missing labels and whatnot.
Arhan tries to figure out where the fire resistance potion is.
After a while, he finds something that looks like a more viscous version of the potions that the peddler down in the undercity.
He either diluted his potions, or just mixed up something that would resemble the real deal.

Bran tries to find all the potions with labels.

- 3 potions of fire resistance.
- 5 potions of healing.
- 8 with skull and crossed bones.
- 4 with something resembling a mountain.
- 1 with a depiction which slightly resembles Brynjar.
- 3 with a water droplet.

They will pay the healer properly, but she tells them that she is up for almost anything.
Arhan offers to get her some fried chicken, so he heads out and tries to find some.

Brynjar is playing his lute in the background as it seems to please Wilhelmina.
**This should be a song.
LSD?**

Bran finds some kind of telepathic potion, but decides that we probably couldn't afford them.
Some potion with a label with a small stick figure turning into a bigger stick figure, which he takes.

He takes the fire restiance potions, the potions of healing, the Brynjar potion, and the enlarging potion.
Bran and Brynjar exits the hut as Arhan comes back with the chicken.

Now they head back to the inn to pick up Zamrachad.
As they pass by the elevator, Arhan think he spots Zamrabob goin into the elevator, which is going down.
They decide to go back to the inn and pick up Zamrasard and go back down to chase after the other Zamrasard/Zamrabob/Zamrawhatever.

Back down in the undercity.
Zamrachad is still sleeping, and Brynjar is carrying him around.

Start sweeping the area to see if they can find the old man.
They are unable to find him, and they decide to get Wlfrica to help them track him.

Wlfrica needs something to go on.
They go to the elevator and ask the guards if they saw an old man come down just before us.
The guards to remember him after a bit of conferring, and apparently Zamrabob was heading towards the Smelter's District.
Bran heals Zamrasards drunkenness, and now he is back in the game.
He does however feel slightly sick, despite feeling fine at the same time.

The Smelter's District is buzzling with activity.
Wlfrica starts to look around the area, so does the rest of the group.
One of the workeres recognises the description of and old haggard man that goes by the name of Bob.
Apparently he went for the foreman's hut.
They move there and see some people in there as if in a meeting.
The door is closed.
Windows that face the smelters.
They decide to stay around and wait for the meeting to finish, and then track Zamrabob as he comes out.

Wlfrica is made invisible in order to sneak into the foreman's hut to listen in on the meeting.

Three senior members meeting about the mining operation.
Rutheno, Silvana, and a dwarf.
Unhappy about the marchion.
Risk of uprising against the power of the marchion.
Dwarf knew about a party of adventurers going down into mines, and got to know this from someone in the council (likely Oondar then).
Each of these senior members had an aide, and one of these, or even one of the senior members, could have been the doppelganger.
All seemed to be in agreement, and more concerned about the people than anything else.

Wait until the meeting is over and follow the aides?
These are the more likely candidates.
Zamrasard can then cast invisibility on the ones that will follow them.

Rutheno Glowstone and the other dwarf with their aides come out.
Stand in the middle of the street, shaking hands and exchanging a few words.
"Well, hope this works. Talk to you soon."

One of them heads towards the keep that guards the mines (16).
Rutheno heads towards the council chambers (13).
Zamrasard casts invisibility on Brynjar and he follows the dwarf to the keep (16).
Wlfrica stays at the foreman's hut to listen in on Silvana and her aide, a teenage-looking young man.
The aide exits after a while, and Wlfrica follows him.
Heads towards (21).

Follows the dwarf (whose name Wlfrica now knows is Tin) and his aide, a young woman.
They stop, and the dwarf dismiss her.
Will call for her in the evening.
She starts walking towards (21).
Gets deep back into the settlement of Minerton and enters a house in the middle back.
He stands guard outside the house, deciding not to try to sneak into the house after the aide.

Wlfrica continues to follow her aide.
He also ends up in Minerton, but goes to a different house from the other aide.
When he arrives to the door of the house, knocks twice and yells "Mom, Dad, I'm home!".
The door is unlatched and he is let in.
The door is shut and barred behind him.
Apparently a multi-family house with at least one family on each of the two floors.

Bran is following Rutheno and his aide, and they walk straight through the council building, ending up on the backside.
There is an arena there, and they sit down for a chat.
Bran listens in.
"... once you've shopped all that, bring it to the house and tell the missus to cook something up."
The aide slips past the invisible Bran while Rutheno stays at the arena.
The aide goes to the market to shop for groceries.
Continuing to follow the aide, Bran finds what he thinks is Rutheno's house.

Back to Brynjar.
The house looks pretty abandonded.
After a while a guy looking very similar to Pritchard, but from the lack of the cross-shaped scar on his forehead, it's not Pritchard2.
He starts walking off, and Brynjar steps out of the way and starts to follow him.
He walks off to the registration office by one of the elevators.
Brynjar stands guard outside, and he takes a lap around the building and spots a man in a long dark coat, standing in line inside.

Wlfrica's invisibility has dropped.
Brynjar accidentally scares her, and she pulls out her dagger and stabs him.

Just after this, a clerk rushes out of the registrars office and calls for the guards.
Pritchard rush out of the office with guards on his tail.
They manage to capture and restrain him.
They are carrying him off towards (18).

The group all meet up again and decides to go into the headquarters of the Axe of Mirabar and see what became of this Pritchard figure.
Zamrasard draws the Baron card, but the clerk is not really impressed.
Brynjar has had enough and tries to intimidate the clerk, but fails.
A voice pipes up behind them.
It's a clerk from the registrars office who says that this Pritchard figure has been harassing them, and at one occasion tried to steal the register from them.

The clerk at the Axe has had enough, and calls for the second in command at the Axe.
After 15-20 minutes, the clerk comes back.

"Protector Ardiel will see you know" he says, pointing to the stairs.

There is a fancy door upstairs with a plaque that says "Protector Ardiel".
It's a small office that is filled to the brim with weapons, armour, and *a lot* of books.

"Ah, I remember you from the arena.
Take a seat and let's get this matter over with."

They tell her about the plans they found that Mirabar would be the next target.
They also tell her about the doppelgangers, and that they just caught one of the doppelgangers and currently have him in their custody.

"If we are not allowed to interrogate him very quickly, it will be near impossible to get a hold of him again" Bran tells Ardiel.

Will invite the group to take part in the interrogation of this Pritchard figure.
Until then, the group will check out the house that Pritchard came out from, the same house that the aide of Tin went to.

Standing outside the door in the middle of Minerton.
Some people coming and going around the group, but they are not really paying attention.
Zamrasard peeks through one of the windows and sees something that resembles a DIY store.
Two floors, no one on the bottom floor.
Stairs leading up to the second floor.
Zamrasard teleports into the house together with Bran, and they remove the bar of the door.
Find nothing in particular on the bottom floor.
Upstairs is a bedroom, relatively nicely furnished considering the neighbourhood.

Brynjar finds some boxes that look like they've been moved relatively recently.
He doesn't find anything, and neither does Arhan.
Bran, on the other hand, finds something that looks like a trapdoor.

"You are definitely mistaken, Bran. There's nothing there, I checked." says Brynjar to Bran.

Zamrasard tries to teleport throught the trapdoor, but it seems to fail completely as he shimmers out of existance just to appear in the same place as where he started.

Bran and Brynjar manage to break the trapdoor open after a lot of failed attempts at trying to find the mechanism for the trapdoor.
On a shelf there are four potions that look very familiar.
The potions from the hags, red ones.
They seemed to be hidden away, but hidden in plain sight.
Other than that, there doesn't seem to be much down there.
It looks kind of like a terrorist cell hideout, but whoever has been using it have been really careful making sure that no tracks are left behind.

Bran mends everything he broke, with a spell of his.
He also set a warding glyph on the fron door so that he is made aware if someone comes back.
