Sharpenov has an office in the export offices.
Brân and Zamrachad go to talk to Sharpenov to inquire about Oondar's business.
Brynjar stays in his room and practises his songs.
Sharpenov is... smart.
He doesn't fall for their charm.

Zamrachad wants to stay outside the export offices and cast invisibility on himself as soon as he sees Sharpenov or Oondar coming out/in.
The problem is that they don't know what Oondar looks like.

Brynjar: 4 inspiration.

Noble clothing and a hat of our choice from a manservant of the nobility where Brynjar is supposed to perform.
Are being taken to the house (Hall of Allfire; 13) where the party will take place.
At least 50 people attending.
Are told to not bother the guests just yet.
Bringing in some beverages and things to eat.
Brynjar wants a beer, but is denied by Brân.

"Head" of the party (lord of the manor) seems to be Henry van Floofernerdle, a gnome.
He knows that Brân and Zamrachad have been inquiring about Oondar.
Long talk between Brân and Henry.

Oondar comes in.
Wants autograph from Brynjar.
His brother went missing in the mines.
Wants the group to go down into the mines to find any sign of his brother that went missing down there.

Brynjar performs, and he does great!
Earns a total of 2090 gold, 1500 from Henry and another 590 from people that throw gold and gems at him.

Go out of the house.
Oondar leading the group towards the mines.
This is kind of fishy.
He hasn't even told them the name of his brother.
They confront him with that, and he tells them his name is Iindar.
Oondar will follow them to the bottom of the elevator, but no further.

In the elevator, Zamrasard casts a spell that somehow makes Oondar gain the courage to find his brother.
Amazing!

The elevator reaches the bottom, and Oondar says to them that they're supposed to investigate the disappearance of the previous investigatory group that the council sent.
"Beware of the northern passages" says the guards by the elevator.

After wandering for a while, the group run into a walking brain.
It attacks Wlfrica severly, almost killing her.
Brân takes her back to the elevator.

At the position where this brain-thingy was fought there is some kind of magical barrier blocking the way.

Further searching the mines, the groups run in to a bunch of black puddings that nearly get the better of them.
Arhan saved the day by chucking two fireballs at them.
