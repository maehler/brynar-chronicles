There are still a few days left until we get the armours that we ordered, so we will just hang around in the city until it's time to leave for the next adventure.

Construction of the main house with cellar, as well as a palisade.
Talking to Ira, and according to her, hags are solitary.
(Hags are the ones we think have produced the potions that we found earlier.)
They used to have a delivery portal to Silvery Moon, but it has been shut down.

In one of Markarth's letters, the "long time in the saddle" was mentioned.
We are starting to think that this is a reference to the city Longsaddle, northwest of Nesmé.

Wives' tales about witches living in the north from here.
They are known to do business with the druids.
We agree to talk to Grog about this and see what information he has for us.
Brynjar won't join that conversation.

Witches Vale in the north.

Fast-forward to where we get the armour.
Pritchard goes away with Mortimer to get him some new rags.

We get all our armour, and start to leave the city.
We're going north, same way as we took up towards Kell Bellhon.
We get all the way to where we encountered the ogres last time we came around this way.
The ogre camp is empty, so we continue north.

After another day, we reach the source of the river.
From there, we cut north-west toward the river Mirabar.
We're making our way towards Mirabar, with Pritchard as our guide.

After a few days, we reach a path going south-north.
We are fairly certain that we're close to reaching the northen tip of the western river that goes down to Kell Bellhon.
There we spot tracks of orcs, going north.
About a dozen of them by the looks of it.
We start heading north, and by the end of the day we reach the banks of the river Mirabar.
One path leading upstream (north-east) and a much smaller, less used, path going south-west.

Setting camp.
No fire.
First two watches go by without any disturbances (Brynjar and Zamrasard).
The third watch, however, Brân hears cracking and wakes up Brynjar.
Brynjar rouses the rest of the group.

Brân lights a fire and tells everyone to stand in a circle around it with their backs against it, prepared to kill anything that they hear.
Brân and Brynjar hear something in the east, and Brân sees a pair of glowing eyes 50 ft out into the forest.
A shadow scampers off and disappears.
Brân seems to be exhausted by this encounter for some reason.

Dawn arrives and we continue on the road north east.
As we set out, Brân directs his attention to Brynjar, and asks him what he knows about lycanthropes.
He says he knows enough in order to stay away from them.

It seems that the orcs have ventured further than would be indicated by the information we got from Bell Kellhon.

Brynjar goes in the front of the group on his horse, when he sees a kind of alcove in a rock formation up ahead to the right of the path.
The alcove seems to be ten feet wide, and a warm light, maybe a campfire, comes out from it.
Pritchard sneaks up towards the light, and he steps on a twig.
Then we all hear a couple of orc voices uttering something guttural.

Pritchard sees a group of four orcs and fires a bolt at one of them.
He hits him good, and then hides.
The orc that was hit rushes out, and since he cannot find Pritchard, he rushes and attacks Brân, but misses.
Another orc comes out and also attacks Brân, and this one hits.
Zamrasard takes down one of the orcs while Brynjar takes down another.
It looks like one of them wants to escape, but before he can do that, Pritchard gets a couple of arrows into him and Brân delivers the final blow with his flying hammer.
The skull of the last orc is cleaved by Zamrasard.

Pritchard finds a chest in the alcove.
There are potions in it.
8 tantrum, 6 bluish/black ones, and 1 green potion.
Suddenly we spot a warewolf on the bluff above the alcove.
It observes the battlefield for a bit, but when it realises that we're observing it, it starts to move away into the forest.

We start to make our way upstream towards what we think is the Witches Vale.
Behind the mountains and into the vale.
After about an hour or two, we see the tracks of the orcs going off to the right, up into the foothills.

Pritchard sees an opening in the cliff.
The group tries to sneak up towards Pritchard, but Brynjar fails miserably.
Meanwhile, the rest of the group spots an ogre in front of the cave entrance.
There are a whole bunch of bones strewn about the cave entrance.
Fiiight!

Zamrasard makes his way across the area, but the ogre spots this and moves up to striking range and hits Zamrasard with his great club.
As Brynjar slashes at the ogre with his greataxe, he sees a blue shimmer as he hits it with his axe.
Brynjar is very confused, because to him it seemed that he dealt a lot of damage, but the ogre seems unhurt.

Zamrasard slits the belly of the beast open, and it slumps to the ground.
