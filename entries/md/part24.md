Down in Mirabar.
Shopping and whatnot.
Lockdown due to the upcoming council meeting.

Pritchard looks for Alyssa (Elisa?), one of Kargosh's contacts/informants.
Secret phrase "golden lovely donkey balls".
"I prefer diamonds" is her response.
Yellow scarves to separate the group from the doppelgängers.
"You can find me at the Ardent Anvil".

Prithcard then goes to the smelter, since the other contact of Kargosh (spelling?) is the foreman there.
Finds a foreman's shack where they can speak undisturbed.
His men have seen late night patrols from the keep carrying crates with unkown content.
Rumour of wounded soldiers from underground returning.
Get's the same directives as he gave Elisa.
They've had issues with Luskan spies.

Games will be held in the arena after the High Harvest.
Right now it's not used for much at all, except for letting criminals rough eachother up.

Arhan sits down with the dark blade for a one-on-one session.
"Don't get stabbed by someone else" the blade concludes.

The guild leaders are the strongest in the council.
Miner's guild (The Pitmen): Rutheno Glowstone
Stokers guild (smelting plants): Silvana Longpoke
Gemcutter's: Iolen Sharpenov
Smith's guild: ...

Mirabar used to be run only by the council.
After the time of troubles, a witch took control as the Marchion and set up a hereditary system.
"Enlightened dictatorship".
No one knows if the current Marchion has any magical powers.
Recluse.

As they exit the inn, there is an influx of offical looking people.

The registrars office doesn't have any entries with the names of anyone in the group.
Pritchard tries to nick the ledger, but fail.
"Don't show yourself in here again!" the registrar roars at him.

At the inn Brynjar hear people shushing eachother down by the tables.
He tries to lean in to one of the conversations to get them to keep going, but the shut down completely when he does.
They can't really determine what they are talking about.
Arhan approaches the barman and manages to get him to talk.
"We've been hearing about people disappearing in the mines.
Wounded soldiers.
Some kind of discovery."

The barman points to a table of people (dwarves and humans) that supposedly returned from a shift a couple of days ago, and they haven't really talked since.
"They might have seen some shit" Arhan says.
Arhan gets introduced to the group by the barman.
"Our mining practices are mostly hammer and pickaxe, really, kind of boring for someone like you."
Disagreement between the guilds.
Competing interests.

Arhan gets a sense of them not being entirely truthful when it comes to any new discoveries that have made.
They seem to be looking for something.
"Don't worry about what you find, just go deeper" one of the foremen had said.

Make their way into the nicer part of the establishment.
Pritchard tries to squeeze in at a table of old coots that might know something, but he gets dismissed, very clearly.
On Arhan's initiative they move to another table.
Arhan orders some nice wine, and he sends one bottle to the table of the old men as an apology.
An apology that is apparently accepted.

As the night goes on, it doesn't seem that any information will come from the table of old guys, and the establishment is getting less crowded as it's getting late.
They move to a different table, and are able to charm (more like shove) themselves in.

Brynjar tries to charm the crowd by playing the hymn of Stone Bridge, but to no avail.
The waitress actually approaches us and asks him to stop.
Brynjar sulks, but does as she says.
"All kinds of rumours about everything and nothing, even dragons."

It's starting to get quite late, so they make their way back to their rooms.
They sleep soundly during the night, and awake quite late the next morning.
Council-meeting-day.

As soon as they leave the inn.
At the square by the elevator there is now a big podium set up, ready for the Marchion's address at the end of the council meeting.
Guards are stationed around the area.

Arhan tries to position himself close to the keep, anticipating the arrival of miners from below.
Less than a minute passes before a guard approaches him.
"Stop loitering, move on" he says to Arhan, who does as he says.

Pritchard claims that they have been tagged by certain organisations.
Apparently they are meant to be procured by them, whatever that means.

The day draws to a close, and nighttime approaches.
About 7:30 there is a single horn blast from outside.
The bartender comes over to Arhan and tells him that was the signal that things are being wrapped up, and that the Marchion's address will be held within the hour.

A procession makes its way towards the podium.
Another procession makes their way from the southern keep towards the podium.
An apparently female form appears on the podium, masked with gemstones and gold.
People are cheerful and happy that the month-long curfew is over.
Everyone and their dog are there.

Suddenly a voice booms in the cavern, and assumingly it's the Marchion talking.
It's a very patriotic speech.
The wall to the south falls and reveals a ship, plated with metal, and something like cannons.
She also reveals that something has indeed been discovered, something that can smelt the toughest of ores.
The sides of the podium falls to the side and reveals a juvenile red dragon.
"Together we will forge our great destiny!"
The crowd goes nuts!

An old elf approaches Brynjar.
Something seems off about him, but he can't say what.
He hands him a note and then walks off

> “A dinner party in commemoration of a dearly departed will be held tonight, at 20:00 hours, in the house of Gust Silverhand. Use the back entrance, and be discrete. The old man has gotten himself a new barrel of beer."

After inquiring with random people, a dwarf approaches Brynjar that stands out as a sore thumb in the crowd of dwarves.
"Didn't it say to be discrete?"

He speaks loudly about it having been such a long time since they had out of town guests, and that we will have to take the back entrance.
He leads us into a chilly antechamber that emenates a lot of magic, as far as Arhan can tell.
"Be on your guard" Arhan tells Zamrachad.

Past the antechamber there is a room with two big furnaces and two ceremonial dwarven armours.
There is a feeling that they are being observed by the suits of armour.
There is an apparently empty table, and by the table a tall cloaked figure was standing.
It's the drow Drizzt Do'Urden.
