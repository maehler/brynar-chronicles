Marchion covered in a flowing gown and red/bronze mask covering her face.

"There may yet be some meaningful way that you could amend this situation, but first: who let you into the mine, and on whose authority did you act" says the Marchion.

Zamrachad gives Oondar away.
Oondar is visibly frightened, and he tries to talk himself out of it by claiming that they are a group of Luskanite agents that threatened to kill him.
He also claims to have evidence of this, and refers to the Pritchard doppelganger that is being held in a cell in the city.

"Pritchard" is brought into the room, and is interrogated by the Marchion.
He is throwing himself at the feet of the Marchion begging for mercy.
This is definitely proof that this is not the real Pritchard.

The Marchion approaches Pritchard, and as she bends down to him, Pritchard lunges up and starts clawing at her face.
He manages to rip the mask off her face.
Her eyes are glowing, and her skin is red, covered in scales.
The guards beside Pritchard immediately attack him, and blue blood spurts all over the place.
He manages to utter a single word before the last drop of life runs out of him: "Dragon..."

"Execute them all!" the Marchion orders, starting to leave the room.
The guards approach the group, but as the Marchion regains some of her composure, she stops.
"Wait, we'll deal with them later."

They are all bound and set down in a circle in the middle of the room.
Arhan recaps what happened in the mines for Bran, and all colour disappears from Bran's face.

After a while the Marchion comes back and sits down on the throne.
She motions to the guards to remove the corpse of Pritchard.
They do so.

She acknowledges that they all have been deceived by doppelgangers, but still that there might be a seed of truth in the story of fake Pritchard.

The Marchion is not convinced that we all are not doppelgangers, so she gets us to prove they're not by spilling some of their blood.
Oondar is a doppelganger!
Fight!

After some fighting, Oondar tries to escape.
Brynjar tries to grapple him, but fails.
Finally, one of the guards puts an arrow through his head, and he falls down dead.
Bran revives him.

They start questioning him, but very few useful answers comes out of him.
After a while Oondar is taken away and put into a cell.

"Take this message to Nesme: Nesme shall become tributaries of Mirabar.
Troops, annual tribute.
They will help us build an army to take down Luskan."

A dwarven woman comes in from the back carrying a tray.
"Restrain them," the Marchion says.
The dwarf approaches Zamrasard and picks up something small from the tray with a pair of thongs.
It's small and slimy, something slug like, and she puts it in his ear.
She proceeds to put these slugs into the ears of all of our heroes.

"These are intellect devour larvae.
Guards, send them off to Nesme with their weapons, and give them some horses as well."
