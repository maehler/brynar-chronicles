The group is now on the second floor of the Sunken Stone Inn.
They snatched some letters and some gear.
The alarm that went off when Pritchard opened a chest, and the group barred the door and jumped out the window.
Umlu and Alboorth are in the Pure Gold Bank.

Pritchard and Brynjar manage to get out unscathed, but both Brân and Zamrasard do faceplants.
Pritchard takes the lead and starts to head towards the stairs.
At that point Brân realises that the Umlu and Alboorth are left behind.

- We can't leave them, he says to Pritchard.

Brynjar follows him back to the Pure Gold Bank.
A face leaning around the corner, and it's Alboorth.

- We heard the alarm, he says to Brân and Brynjar.

- We need to get the hell out of here, says Brân.

Pritchard and Zamrasard are waiting by the stairs (1).
Pritchard realises that if they can just stay quiet, the orchs will probably not notice them.
He starts waving like a maniac towards Brynjar and Brân, obviously wanting them to stop.

Brynjar is so confused, so he slowly stops just for that reason.
At that point, around 20 orchs run past on the opposite side of the concourse.
As the last orch has passed by, the group makes a move towards the stairs.
They reach it and they start climbing it.
They soon reach the point where the ladder exits at ground level, were they first entered.

It is now late afternoon.
No idea whether or not the orchs are still on top of the walls or in the courtyard.

- Let's get out, and any orchs we encounter we'll deal with, says Pritchard.

Pritchard opens the door in the wall, and we all make our way out.
(Inner courtyard littered with a war camp.)

Trying to sneak towards the main gates, but at least one orch spots us on the way.

- Ruuuun! Brynjar screams off the top of his lungs.

Zamrasard casts some kind of sphere of darkness in front of us.

- Run towards the darkness for cover, Zamrasard screams.
Meanwhile arrows are flying around their ears.
Brân takes an arrow to the bum.
It's about 1000 meters to the forest, and they make it there, unmolested.

- Do we take the quickest route? Pritchard

- Speed is our ally, Brân

- Me and Alboorth have to get back to Mithril hall, says Umlu.

- What about the mission, asks Alboorth.

- What mission? asks Brynjar.

- We were sent to Kell Bellhon to ascertain if it had been occupied. There are systems for keeping intruders out of Kell Bellhon. Umlu.

- And you're telling us now? Pritchard.

- Part of the team that doubled as pest control. We were checking if it was still possible to activate it. We don't know if it works as it should, or if it would just go haywire and kill everything in their way.

- No point in discussing this now, we have to make some distance between Kell Bellhon and us, says Pritchard.

After some discussion, the group decide to go to Mithril Hall and take a boat from there down to Nesmé.
They start marching as night is falling.

Brynjar is still feeling like shit after the fight with Markarth, and he downs a potion of lesser healing.
Brân grabs the right buttcheek of Brynjar, and at the same time heals him magically.

- That feels really good, says Brynjar.

A while later

- I see something ahead, a glow, possibly a fireplace, Brân says. Could you go check it out, Pritchard?

- It looks like it's burning out, says Pritchard.

Pritchard sneaks up towards the fireplace.
As he stands there, and old, awkward man comes up.

- Hello there! he says. What brings you to our fire, traveller? Come on, have an ale, sit down. Bring your friends as well!

The rest of the group hears the conversation, but mostly only hears something about ale.

- Hail and well met, says Brân to the old man.

- I'm... Well, the name escapes me at the moment, but it's not that important.

- Where are your friends?

- Well, I actually met her just a few days ago.

- It is the height of imprudence drinking wine with someone whose name you do not know.

- Ok, ok. I will try to recall it... My name is... El.

Zamrasard notices a figure walking outside the camp.
It's a female dwarf carrying a bundle of wood.
Umlu recognises the female dwarf and runs up to her.

- Wolfrika, is that you? says Umlu.

- I was so worried about you brother! she says Wolfrika. We were afraid that you all had perished there.

Wolfrika Moonstone is the brother of Umlu.
They thought that they'd lost everyone in the party.
She embraces Brân.

Pritchard stuffs a flagon of ale into the hands of Brynjar.

- Take this and sit down, because this is going to take a while, he says.

The ale is exquisite, and Brynjar has never tasted anything like it before.
He doesn't even dare to gulp it down immediately, like he normally would.
He just sits there, sipping carefully with his mind wandering.
He doesn't even notice the conversation that is happening around him.
As Brynjar sits there, sipping his beer, he starts thinking: who carried this giant barrel of ale here?

- It might have been me, it might have been Wolfrika, but I'm not sure, says El.

Brynjar notices that there are no cups left.

- I think that Umlu and Wolfrika would like a cup as well, Brynjar says to El.

- Ah, how rude of me, he says as he reaches with his empty hands down to the spigot, and two cups materialise in his hands.

Brynjar draws his great axe and points it at El.

- Who the hell are you!?

He tries to intimidate El in order to find out, but to no avail.

Pritchard then remembers that Drizzt Durden is looking for and old confused man that he wants to meet in Mithril Hall.

- I think this might be the famous El Minister, says Pritchard. Let's escort him to Mithril Hall before. Thank you for the beer, but now we should get going.

- We're about 4-5 hours from the gate, but we can probably get there a bit faster if we hustle.

They make it to the foothills without any sign of pursuit.

Brân spots a giant tree in the distance.

'Now, that's a sight I haven't seen in a long time' says Brân.

'Yeah, that fucking druid' says El. 'Such an asshole', and he just keeps walking.

After a while, Wolfrika approaches a rock formation, and a hatch opens.

'Who goes there?' someone shouts.

'We have ale!' Pritchard shouts back.

Wolfrika interrupts and says that she's brought back survivors from the mission to Kell Bellhon.

30x30 foot tunnel, perfect craftmanship.

Quite dark, so Brynjar lights his torch.

They walk for about 3.5-4 hours.

For the past 8 hours, Alboorth hasn't said a single word.
Brynjar knocks on his helmet, and he replies.
Apparently, he has been sleeping.

'Is it possible to get one of those in my size?' asks Brynjar.

'Yes, but it will cost you' says Alboorth before going back to sleep.

We reach a guarded doorway, and after a short exchange with Wolfrika, they open the doors.
The city of Mithril hall extends beyond the doors.
A city almost entirely made out of mithril and surrounded by an enormous network of mines.

The guards lead us to a ship.
The dwarves have crafted an artificial harbor inside the mountain from various underground streams that leads out to the river.

Umlu and Alboorth thank our adventurers for saving their lives.

They board the longship, and to their dissappointment there are no bunks anywhere on the ship.
Both Pritchard and Brynjar fall asleep in a not so small pile.

The dwarven captain arrives and starts to move the ship towards Nesmé.

'My job is to take you to Nesmé, leave you in Nesmé and return to Mithril Hall without asking any questions', says the dwarven captain.

Zamrasard hands the letter of Markarth to the captain and asks him to translate it for us.

It sounds like it is a letter to a woman, and it sounds very innocent.
It is signed off with 'Marky'.
Pritchard thinks that this is an encrypted message to his superiors.
The other letters seem to be in more clear text, and they are requesting potions.

By now the ship has arrived at the river and is making its way down the stream.

The group takes a rest, but they are not able to sleep very well.

After a while, they see a big black cloud, approximately at the point where they would expect Nesmé to be.
As they approach, the cloud seems to calm down a bit, but it is still there.
The crew of the ship is starting to get worried, and they are starting to talk about turning the ship around and going back to Mithril Hall.

The captain is convinced to continue to Nesmé.

As they approach Nesmé, Brynjar sees some big looking shapes flying above the city.
They seem to be too big too be seagulls, but too small to be dragons.
Two largeish flying creatures flying above the city.
One of them is starting to move towards the ship.

Brynjar manages to convince the captain to turn the ship towards the shore.
As the flying creature gets closer, Brynjar recognises the flying creature to be a Griffin, and it has a rider.
It might be the Griffon Tribe of Uthgardt barbarians that we asked for help earlier!

For two hours the group walk across the moors and heather until they reach Nesmé.
It seems that what has been burning was mostly farms and structures outside of the walls, but the walls seem to have withstood the attack.
There are a lot of people on the walls.

'Who are you?' they ask.

'We are back from our scouting mission, open the gate.'

'We can't just open the gate for anyone, do you have anyone that can vouch for you?'

'Where is Stouthand, he can vouch for us.'

'He's out hunting orchs on the north shore.'

'What about Hirven Ira (?)'

After a while she the halfling council member shows up, and she recognises them.
The orchs were nothing like they had seen before, and they could barely hold them off.
At the last moment, the Griffon Tribe arrived and that was what was needed in order to turn the tide and fight off the orchs.

'Did you succeed with your mission?' she asks.

Brân explains how we got to Bell Kellhon, fought our way through the fortress and killed Markarth before heading towards Mithril Hall and finally getting a boat to Nesmé.

Finally the group are able to get a full nights rest after a very long day.
