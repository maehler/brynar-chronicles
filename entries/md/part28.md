In the firepit of the mines, with salamanders, and a firethrowing/breathing creature yet to be revealed.

Br√¢n approaches one of the salamanders and puts his weapons on the ground in an attempt to show that they mean no harm.

Zamrasard offers his necklace of small fire balls to one of the salamanders, but it doesn't pick it up.
The group starts to retreat, but Brynjar sees that the other salamander is hiding behind one of the stalagmites, ready to pounce.
At the same time, the other salamander picks up the necklace.
As it does so, the chain burns, and a single ball falls to the ground.
A fireball erupts, and the salamander is *not* happy about that.

Fiiight!

Brynjar is hasted, but he totally fucks up his attacks.
Zamrasard, on the other hand, doesn't.
Single-handedly he kills off one of the salamanders, and has time to deal quite a bit of damage to the second one before it draws Brynjar down into the pit of lava.
Zamrasard manages to kill off the second salamander as it draws Brynjar further into the lava pit.

After struggling for a while, they manage to get Brynjar up to the walkway, who is pretty scorched by now.

The group makes its way to the level above in order to get some rest.

Back down, and Zamrasard explores the tunnel beyond the archway.
There is a click as he enters, and a fireball erupts.
Venturing further into the cavern, he sees a dragon's head.
Made from stone and metal.
Its mouth is slowly closing as Zamrasard enters the main part of the cavern.
Beneath the head is an enormous pile of treasure.

On his way out of the cavern, there is another click, and another fireball.
He makes his way out, a bit zinged, and with him he has a big bag of treasure, a short bow and a battle axe.

They head back to the surface, and back to the inn.

Find Oondar and tell him what they found.
Found evidence of a dragon, but did not actually see the dragon.
No signs of Oondar's brother, just a bunch of corpses with no real identifying marks on them.

Wlfrica is taken to priests associated with the Axe of Mirabar.
Trond, priestess.

Find someone peddling potions in the marketplace, and a dwarf is trying to sell them fire resistance potions for a far lower price than what they are worth.
