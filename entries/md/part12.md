Ogre is slayed.
A lot of bones from humanoids, and animals.
Blood and guts.
Trail leading up above the cave entrance, can't really see further.

We enter the cave.
The first part seems natural, but pretty fast it is evident, at least for Brân, that the stone has been worked.
Cartwheel tracks going in and out of the cave.
Dust and pebbles have been swept to cover up the tracks.
Brynjar lights up a torch and walks just behind Pritchard as he checks for traps.
After about 20 feet the cave widens, and there is a large pile of skeletons lying there.
Pritchard stumbles on a femur, and as he does that the rest of the group hears a whispering on the other side of the pile of bones.
In the ceiling there are chains and a torch.
At least 20 ft high.

Zamrasard tries to get to the front of the line, but stumbles and falls into the pile of bones.
He makes a ruckus, and it's evident that someone must have heard us.
Brynjar pulls him out, and at the same time Pritchard spots a light further ahead.

"Get back, hide and be quiet!" he says as he does a somersault over the pile of bones.

The rest of the group follow suit (save the somersault), and Brynjar puts out the torch.
Brynjar sees a torchlight up ahead, and also someone snoring.

"Hey guys, wake up, this is no time to sleep!" he says to the rest.

Zamrasard makes his way back past the pile of bones, with better luck this time.
There is a horse pen to the right.
In the ceiling there is a candelabra filled with wax candles.
The number of chains extended from the ceiling are in the hundreds.
There are four bedrolls on the left side of the cave, and in two there are humans sleeping.
Pritchard makes his way towards the bedrolls in order to dispose of these two humans.
He makes his way there, and he recognises one of them.
It is the woman that was chastised by Markarth at Kell Bellhon.
The other is a male that he does not recognise.
Pritchard tries to finish off the male human, and he does so.
He then makes his way to the woman, and tries to gag her before she can realise what is happening.
He takes the bedroll and covers her in it in order to immobilise her and keep her quiet.
However, she does not stop struggling.
He even puts his dagger against her throat, but she still doesn't stop struggling.
In the end he has to knock her out in order to keep her quiet, but the wound in her throat is pretty bad, and she will bleed out if she doesn't get medical attention.
Pritchard tries to patch her up, and he manages to keep her alive.

Zamrasard sneaks up towards Pritchard.
They decide to drag the bodies down to the pile of bones.
They don't make a great job of it, but they still make it.
The male seems to have been through a lot with the soles of his feet very tattered and torn, and the rest of his body filled with bruises.
Around the neck of the woman, there is a varnished eye.
Zamrasard recognises it as a hag's eye.
Apparently you can look through the eye and keep, so to say, an eye on things on the other side.

Brân and Brynjar investigate the carts standing nearby, and see that the two lower ones are a bit older and more worn compared to the top one that looks brand new.
It seems that the crates next to the carts were designed for transporting potions.

After Brân fails to wake her up, Brynjar gives it a shot, and actually manages.
As soon as she gets back to reality, she starts screaming, but since she's gagged, not much sound escapes.
Brân manages to calm her down, and removes the gag.
As soon as he does, she starts to laugh manically, and Brân covers her mouth.
Zamrasard draws his sword, apparently trying to kill her.
Brân stops him at the last moment.
Pritchard asks her "You do want to die, don't you".
Her eyes lock onto him, and she slowly nods while tears are rolling down her cheeks.

"If you tell me where they are, I promise I will do this for you, and I will do it quick."

She seems calm and submissive, and Pritchard removes the gag.
She's frantic.

"Kill me! Murder! Death! Kill! Death, death, death! Kill me, kill me now!"

"Nah, sorry, she's lost" says Pritchard.

Brân puts back the gag and stows her in one of the carts.
He manages to stow her away, albeit not very quietly.

Brân, Brynjar and Zamrasard start moving towards the door on the top left.
As they get up to the bedrolls, the door next to the door they were aiming for opens.
Brynjar throws himself down on one of the bedrolls and pretends to sleep.
Brân and Zamrasard follow suit.
Nothing comes out though.
Pritchard has his crossbow trained at the door.
Zamrasard makes his way towards the door and peeks inside.

The chains in the ceiling are rattling, and at that point Pritchard sets the cart, where Brân stowed the woman, on fire.
Brân rushes over there and pulls her out of the cart.
She is unconcious and badly burnt, but he heals her.
She's still unconcious, but stable.
The fire spreads to the next cart.

Pritchard goes up to the top left door and investigates it.
It is unlocked.
He enters.
It seems to be an alchemical laboratory of some kind, with a lot of bottles and vials lying around.
There is a dead woman lying on one of the tables.
She seems to have been drained of blood.
20-25 years old.
Well fed.
Birthing hips, you might say.
On a different table there are a lot of alchemical tools.
Flasks, beakers and burners.
A bunch of finished potion flasks, and some unmixed or unfinished ones.
Some have labels which we cannot decipher.

The chains in the ceiling are rattling again.
Never quite passing over us, but going around.

Meanwhile, in the alchemy lab, Brân pushes Pritchard up against a wall.

"Listen to me, and listen carefully. If you hurt someone innocent again, I will kill you."

"Don't make promises that you can't keep" says Pritchard.

They both walk out of there, with a bit of a distance between them.

We go to the door on the lower right.
It has three locks, and Pritchard tries to pick them.
He fails with the second one, and he gets pricked with a needle of some kind.
He starts feeling like he's coming down with some kind of sickness (hag fever).
He manages to open all three locks, but the door doesn't budge.
As this happens, all but Pritchard hears snickering behind them.

"I don't think this door can be opened from the outside" says Pritchard.

Pritchard goes to the door just above the stables.
No traps, no locks.
There is a symbol painted on it.
Seems to be cops of trees and a setting or a rising sun.
None of us can recall where this comes from.

Brân opens the door with a flick of his wrist.
There is a corridor on the other side, faintly lit, as if lit by candle light.
As Pritchard steps into the corridor, he can feel something that feels like someone caressing his cheek.
He continues to make his way in, and he doesn't run in to anything particular.
He sees a chest in the room inside that he intently focuses on.
There are urns on tables in there, and they seem to be filled with ashes, except for one of them.
It seems to have a note stuck down in the ashes.
Pritchard takes the note and unrolls it.
It has a single word written on it.

"Welcome"

The first chest that Pritchard opens contains some women's clothes.
The second chest contains some fancy men's clothes.
The next chest he checks, he gets stuck as soon as he touches it.
A mimic!
Fight!

It slams Pritchard and does some damage to him.
Pritchard is grappled, but he still tries to attack it with his rapier, but he misses.
Next Brân casts his sacred flame at the mimic, and he, on the other hand, hits it.
Next the mimic starts to gnaw at the arm of Pritchard.
Smoke is starting to emenate from his arm.
Brynjar hits the mimic and chops off an ornamental part of the chest which falls to the ground and turns into a blue gobbly goop.
He continues to hit it again, but not as hard.
Zamrasard continues to pummel the mimic, and deals quite a bit of damage.
Next it's Pritchard.
He shoves his rapier straight through the mimic, and it just turns into a blob that slumps to the floor.

Pritchard seems pretty beat-up.
He has been gnawed upon, and he's been burnt by acid.

We make our way out of this room, into the larger cavern, and then to the door at the upper right.
Pritchard checks it for traps, and then opens it.
As he peeks through, a fairly bright light shines at him.
There are three half-orcs in there, looking the other direction.
Beyond the half-orcs, there is the light of fires, silhouetting the half-orcs.
Brân and Brynjar hears the clinking of either pickaxes or sledgehammers against stone in the distance.
The half-orcs are equipped with bows.

Zamrasard tries to sneak up on them, but fail.
Pritchard quickly fires a bolt at the middle one, and puts it in his neck, taking him down.
The left one shoots an arrow at Zamrasard, and hits.
After that he moves into cover.
Pritchard shoots another bolt at the right half orc.
Next, Brân summons a spiritual weapon next to the right orc.
He next casts sacred flame at the same orc, but he side-steps and avoid the flame.
Next, Brynjar rushes madly towards the two half-orcs that have taken shelter behind a pile of logs.
He plants his greataxe square behind the eyes of a very surprised half-orc who slumps to the ground, dead.
Pritchard misses the next half-orc, while Brân attacks with his spiritual weapon, but misses.
Zamrasard avoids the half-orc and leaves it to Brynjar.
Brynjar however misses his first attack, but hits his second.
The half-orc starts to look pretty beat up.
Pritchard puts a bolt in his lungs, and he slumps down while uttering something in orcish.
He's dead.

In a corner of the room there are some humans, that look like slaves.

"Who are you?" one of them asks.
He is a quite muscular human, but pretty torn up.

Brynjar recognises him as a member of the Griffon tribe based on his facial tattoos.
His name is Urdan.

"There is no leaving this place" he says.
.
"If you want to leave, then you'd better leave now."

The two humans run off, but the barbarian stays behind.
There is no way of talking to him.
He is entirely convinced that we all are hags disguised as ourselves.
Brynjar even tries to sing the old Griffon classic, Flight of the Feathered serpent, but to no avail.
He taps his shoulder and tells him "I hope you find peace one day, my friend."

Brynjar recalls the Griffon song "Kemp's Jig".
Brynjar performs it and is able to get Urdan to snap out of his spell, or whatever he was under.

"We have to get out of here!"

As Urdan starts to equip himself with gear from the fallen half-orcs, Zamrasard hears a slow-clap from the entrance to this part of the cave...
