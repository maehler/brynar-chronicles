Long rest.
Wlfrica scouts ahead.
Reach Longsaddle relatively early in the morning.
Probably not more than 200 people in Longsaddle.
Just before reaching town, there is a group of three people standing to the east.
Pritchard and Zamrasard will try to sneak up on them and check them out.
Brân and Brynjar takes care of the horses.
The people that were at the horizon seem to be traders or something.

Making our way to the tavern: The Quizzical Quanderer.
An old man joins our table as Zamrasard pours out his horrible ale.
Last of the Harpell family that founded the town.
He knew some magic, at least before the spell plague.
Teleportation device used to be in the town, for getting quickly between here, Waterdeep, Luskan, Baldur's Gate, you name it.

Brân goes to the smithy, trying to find something that could be of use.
He has a heavy crossbow that he says was left over from when the halfling combat company something, something, wanted to mount them on top of the wolf-like creatures they were riding.

Get rooms at the inn.
The barmaid is less than helpful, that's for sure.

This Harpell guy has information on where you could find magical items; old netherese artefacts, at least this is what he tells Pritchard.
We follow him back to his farm.
Shit looks terrible.

"I haven't done magic since the spell plague, that's the reason for the mess."

We are offered something that looks to be very, very old ale.
We decline the offer.
He wants to get rid of two half-orcs that he does not like.
If we take care of them, as in make them not return to the town.
Like ever.
Like not just convince them to move.
Just saying.

A lot of arguing back and forth about how to handle this situation.
Pritchard and Zamrabob go out to the house of the half-orcs to assess the situation and talk to them.
Brân and Brynjar don't want anything to do with this.

Oskar, a thespian, recently of Waterdeep.
Very vocal, and really, really wants to get a hold of the owner of the establishment, but at least a barmaid or bartender.
Brân gets up and out in order to confront Pritchard.
He goes to the house of the half-orcs in order to see what is going on, drunk as a skunk.

Brân comes back to the Quizzical Quanderer together with one of the half-orcs.
Zamrabob and Pritchard are there as well.

Brân, Brynjar and the female half-orc go to the council.
Argues that Harpell is putting his nose into business were he has no business.
They later continue to the Harpell Hill Farm house.

Meanwhile, Zamrabob and Pritchard make their way to Harpell and confront him.
There is a fight!
It ends up with Harpell clutching a pendant around his neck, and disappearing.
However, Zamrabob reverts the spell though, and Harpell comes back.

"I yield, I yield!"

He gives away the apparent location of the Netherese magical items, and Pritchard takes the dagger from him.

Brân and Brynjar get to the house, and Harpell is clearly upset, and he has a huge bag of scrolls, and he is reaching for something in there while cursing.
Brynjar grapples him, and eventually sits on him and binds him.
He's taken to the dungeon of the town.
There is no trace of Pritchard and Zamrasard.

The mayor of the town wants us to stay in town and to hand in our weapons.
That's definitely not an option.
We are able to talk our way out of that situation.

We start to make our way out of the city before night falls.
The male half orc runs up to us and thanks us.
Pritchard thinks he recognises him as one of the half orcs that attacked us by Kell Bellhon, so he casts zone of truth.
The half orc refuses to answer and starts to run.

We manage to pin him down, and load him onto a horse, and after that we go out of the city and make a camp.
There we realise, or rather Brân realises, that he died.
Brân uses his speak to the dead stuff in order to wake the corpse up a little bit.
It sounds like he has been part of a sleeper cell in Longsaddle, communicating through courier with Mommy.

The map that Zamrasard and Pritchard got from Harpell points to a location in the mountains close to Griffon's Nest, to the east of the road.
