In the company of Drizzt Do'urden in Mirabar.
Elminster, old man.
He might be the key to restore Mistra and restore order.
Caught up a trail north that might be of interest.
Drizzt and Elminstrel heading south.
Next he wants to tell us something that he wants us to swear will not leave the room.
All do.
There's a new and powerful Uthgard leader, Stormfist, in the north, rising in ranks after finding a strange glowing ring.
Drizzt shows them a big jade ring.
Lessens the risk inherent to spellcasting.
Want information on what is going on in Luskan.
Disturbing findings at Candle Keep, disheartening and foreboding.
Associates spread across the land.

Great horned one, also known as Belhifet, a demon.
About a century ago tried to establish in the north.

They are part of the Harpers.

Drizzt safeword: Floaty b00m b00m thingy.

To the bar.
Gut gravel shot.
Bran and Brynjar are drunk as skunks.

To the arena.
Brynjar is set to play during one of the intermissions.
After a bit of setup, Brynjar starts playing.
First it's the Ode to Pritchard.
Secondly he plays the Wolfsbane of Longsaddle.
The crowd and the guards go bananas, but the VIP box is still silent.

Brynjar keeps performing, and the crowd goes wild.
They throw in gold and gemstones as he finishes his performance.
The next performer is Oskar Minnow, a Pritchard-looking guy we met in Longsaddle.
He says that he cannot perform after Brynjar since he and his companions are the slayers of Longsaddle.
Clearly he didn't hear how that story ended.

The group is taken away and put into a store room under the arena.
After a long wait, a stout dwarf in a sturdy armour, kind of looks like half elf half dwarf.
There is also a female character of similar breed.
They also drag in Oskar Minnow.
Brynjar tries to explain the truth to them, but they find it very convenient.

Bran casts zone of truth and starts to explain the whole story to the dwelves.
They buy our story.

Jopen Ardiel and his daughter.
Commander and second in command of the Axe of Mirabar.
The group gets released, and they also get a request from a dwarf dressed in livery for Brynjar to perform at a private event.

Next day.
Breakfast.
Accept the invitation to the private event.
1000 gold + clothing + attendence of all my managers (Brân and Zamrasard) and staff.
Brynjar stays back in the room and practice his songs while the rest of the group go to see Rutheno Glowstone.

Oondar Ce'eginnt is council member number 16.
Mirabar has been mentioned as number 16 and Luskan as number 9.
