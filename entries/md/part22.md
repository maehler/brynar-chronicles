Journey up north towards Mirabar. 1.5 weeks of riding north. Brynjar gets a belt of defence, which boosts his AC. There were also a cursed sword, which is very powerful, but if you try to use it, you'll likely get cursed. There's is also the hag's eye.

Brynjar has a dream that night:

> As you drift off to sleep, you find yourself in a most pleasant dreamscape. Home. The home you’ve left so far behind while your travels have taken you ever onwards lies before you basked in golden sunshine. You wander the streets of your youth and pass many a friend and kinsman who all greet you fondly. Happy to be home, and eager to rest your road-worn bones in the halls of your brother, you stride the winding path uphill to your parent’s estate.  As you enter the gates, the golden light flickers and the gentle breeze which until now stroked your skin turn a reddish ashen hue and the air fills with the stench of death.  Before you the floor is littered with the corpses of your kin, and upon the throne sits a young man cradling his face in blood-stained hands.  He turns to face you, his expression that of a mad man consumed by rage. When his eyes rest upon you it changes to the gentle face of your childhood friend Robbel.  -”Brynjar, welcome back! We’ve all missed you so…" The mad snarl re-enters his gaze and he lunges towards you, eyes flash red as his face turns into a wolf.

It also turns out that Arhan sensing rat smell around Zamrasard was not just a figment of his imagination. Zamrasard does have a rat in his possession, but it is in fact his mother. It is not her true form though, and she's not even in the rat, it is just a vehicle for her.

Brynjar has the same dream again, but this time Robbel says: "Brynjar, look at what you've made me do! High time to pay."

After about three days, they arrive at Zanthar's keep. Brynjar keeps having the bad dreams.

The dream starts the same as the two previous nights. But this time, as you enter the your family’s hall. it is not filled with the corpses of your family. Instead, you find them all quite animated, feasting and dancing. On your arrival, the feast stops, and an eerie silence falls over the hall. When you walk forward, the faces of your family members turn grey and they avert your eyes, as if you had committed an act so shameful they can not bear to look upon you. Try as you might, not one of them will meet your gaze, until you come across your mother.
She stares daggers at you for what seems an eternity, but stays silent. Finally, she speaks.

-”How dare you sully this place with your presence? Have you not done enough harm?!”

At this her face too turns a deathly pale, and blood starts to pour from slash-wounds opening across her face and torso.

-”This is how you left me, and this is how I am forced to linger. Do not return lest you have the means to free me from this curse”

---

Your home stands in flames. The streets through the forest filled with detritus. No one is to be seen.  Frantically you start making your way homewards, desperate to save whomever may yet be saved.

Suddenly a dreadful sense of being observed fills your mind. Glancing over your shoulder, a looming shadow seems to be following you, but you can not bring yourself to face it. Instead you hustle onwards, ever conscious of the shadow’s growing presence. With each step the shadow engulfs more of your peripheral vision, until there’s just a small patch visible in front of you; the door to your home.

One more step, and the wall of darkness slams shut around your, trapping you in a lightless void, with only the sound of crackling fires.

An unfamiliar voice floats through the darkness

-”This is what happens to those who suffer the presence of evil and indulge evil’s ways. Salvation can not come to those stain their souls by permitting evil to be done in the name of good”

---

Tonight you dream a different dream. You see a vision of your childhood friend,a young girl. You experience it as though you could see through her eyes, and yet observe all that goes on around her as she scurries through the household, a soothing cacophony for one whose life has been fraught with uncertainty and extraordinary circumstances. Day in and day out she toils. And with each day she gains a little skill and confidence. You share in her sense of pride at becoming something more than she was, as if you had been there to witness this yourself.

One day a man comes to your parent’s shop. A finely dressed man, with a fine top hat. His cloak is a shade of black you’ve never seen before, and you can’t seem to make out any distinguishing features of his face.

He speaks with Father and you start to get an uneasy feeling that they are talking about you. Father notices you looking at them, an unbearable sadness visible on his face. He calls you over.

-”Brynjar, come here my boy. This is Mr….”
-”Sir.” The cloaked man interjects. “Sir. Pritichard Kavanaugh”

Father looks at you again, tears of blood streaming down his cheeks.

-”It’s time for you to go Brynjar, Sir Kavanaugh will see to your wellbeing, I’m assured.”

A cackling laughter erupts as the black cloak flies open and engulfs your field of view in darkness. You have a sense of falling from a great height and your friend screams as she’s led away by a firm, gloved, hand clutching her neck.

Again, the unfamiliar voice returns in the darkness.

“Well, I’m sure she was seen to... but to whom will the monster look next. You failed your friend, best not fail again“

Spending the night at Zanthal's keep.

---

You stand in a lavishly furnished room, lit by a roaring fireplace that seems to blaze with the heat of the nine hells themselves.

A lithe male figure, wearing a blood-red silken gown sits in a high-backed armchair.

-”Ah, Mr. Storsnorre, how nice of you to drop by. I’ve been looking forward to speaking with you for some time. My associate and her son have told me many impressive things about you. Please, have a seat while we wait for them to join us.”

You have just taken a seat in an equally lavish chair across from the figure, when a bell rings twice and a door opens, seemingly out of nowhere.

In steps a human woman, followed by Zamrasard. They each bow and the woman greets the man as “my lord” before she and Zamrasard sit down at your side.

-”Now, let me try to impress upon you what we can do to help each other, Mr. Storsnorre”

You look around and see Zamrasard and the woman gently smiling and nodding at you.
As you turn back to the man, his eyes are filled with flame. He smiles at you and all turns to darkness.

Pain shoots through your entire body and you linger between the waking world and the dream.

A faint whisper flows through your mind
- ”I think you know what needs to be done”

The group continues towards Mirabar. Brân and Zamrasard thinks that Brynjar might be haunted. They will try to cast a spell in order to fix this. They do that while Brynjar is sleeping, and he immediately calms down. After a couple of nights with this treatment, Brynjar calms down and can sleep through the nights again. However, Brân now has the nightmares Brynjar previously had.

Brân thinks that it is the hag that got away earlier that haunts our dreams. In order to try to get the hag out to the material plane, Brân does some clever magic, and it actually works! The hag is upon the group.

Brynjar deals the final blow, cleaving her face in twain. However, he doesn't stop there. He continues to pummel the hag with his greataxe until there, beating the hag to a pulp.
